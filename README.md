# Audio Defence — Windows and Mac port

A port of *Audio Defence: Zombie Arena* (Somethin' Else, iOS, 2015) to Windows
and the Mac:
the audio-only shooter you play by listening, turning towards a zombie you can
hear and firing before it reaches you. Endless mode, the challenge worlds, the
armory, the tarot cards, the Zombiepedia — and the whole of it through a screen
reader, because that is how the original was meant to be played.

The original was pulled from the App Store years ago and never came to anything
else. It needs a phone you may no longer own, running an OS that will not
install it. This port exists so it can be played on a desktop, with a keyboard
and NVDA or VoiceOver, by people who cannot see the screen and never needed to.

It is playable from the logo to the last challenge. If you find something that
sounds wrong, say so — most of what is fixed in here was found by someone
playing it and describing what they heard.

## Accessibility

The port is built for a screen reader, not adapted to one afterwards. It speaks
through **NVDA** when NVDA is running; through **JAWS**, **ZDSR**, **Narrator**,
**ZoomText**, **System Access**, **Window-Eyes**, **PC-Talker**, **Boy PC
Reader** or **Sense Reader** when one of those is, tried in that order (through
the Prism library); and through the **SAPI 5** voice when none is — nothing else is
required, and there is no visual mode worth using. A screen reader started or
closed while the game runs is followed within a few seconds. The game is the
same whichever speaks: with SAPI 5 you get every screen and the spoken game
exactly as an NVDA player does.

That choice is automatic. **Speech output**, the first row of **First speech
settings** in the Speech tab of Settings, picks one
instead — NVDA, JAWS, ZDSR, Narrator, ZoomText, System Access, Window-Eyes,
PC-Talker, Boy PC Reader, Sense Reader or SAPI 5 — with Enter for the next and
Shift+Enter for the previous, and Automatic, the default, at the start of the
list. The one you pick is the only one used: while it is not running the game
is silent, even with another screen reader running. The row itself always tells
you what you picked, through the automatic choice when the one you picked
cannot speak ("JAWS is not running, so the game will be silent until it is"),
so you can step on to another without being left in silence.

While SAPI 5 is what speaks — chosen, or Automatic with no screen reader
running — more rows follow it on the same page, for SAPI 5 itself. They
come and go by themselves as a screen reader starts or closes:

| row | what it does |
|---|---|
| **SAPI 5 voice** | the voice set in Control Panel (the default), then every installed voice |
| **SAPI 5 rate** | -10 to 10, starting where Control Panel has it |
| **SAPI 5 rate boost** | faster again than the rate allows — only for a voice that can, which the game tries once per voice to find out |
| **SAPI 5 pitch** | -10 to 10, 0 being the voice's own |
| **SAPI 5 volume** | in steps of 10%, starting where Control Panel has it |

Enter and Shift+Enter change each one, and each change is said in SAPI 5 at the
new setting, even while NVDA speaks the rest, so you hear what you chose. Reset
all settings puts all five back to Control Panel's.

**Test speech**, after those rows on each speech's page (straight after Speech
output when there are none), reads a sentence in that speech as it is set now:
through its Speech output, with its voice, rate, pitch and volume. A screen
reader simply reads it. On Second speech settings it works whether Use second
speech is on or not, and on the phone it reads with that speech's engine.

Many items and rows carry a hint, such as "Press Enter for the list". As
VoiceOver does, the game reads the item first and the hint on its own after
it, once the item has been read and a pause has passed. Two rows at the end of
the Speech tab set this, on the phone too: **Hints** (on by default) turns
hints off, and **Pause before hints** sets the pause, from 0 to 3 seconds in
quarters of a second, 1 second by default; at 0 the hint follows straight on.
A key, a touch, or a move to another item before the hint comes takes it away.
A braille display shows the item and its hint together, at once.

The game works out when the item has been read from how fast your speech
reads, whatever speaks it: a screen reader, SAPI 5, the Mac's system voice or
the phone's own. It counts the item's words, allows each the time you measured
with **Speech calibration**, and starts the pause from there. The Extra mode's
story is timed the same way: its wave comes once it has been read. Until the
speech has been measured, the game allows an ordinary pace, 180 words a minute.

**Speech calibration** is a row of each speech's page, on Windows, the Mac
and the phone, and it says the pace measured, such as "240 words a minute".
Press Enter and a sentence is read; press Enter again the moment it ends, and
the game works out how long a word takes. Escape, or any other key, cancels,
and a press far too early or far too late is turned away without changing
anything. The measurement belongs to the speech, not to one voice: changing
Speech output or the voice keeps it, so calibrate again when you change the
voice or its speed. Reset all settings forgets it.

Until the speech has been measured, the game asks you to: when it starts,
after the logo and before the intro, and straight after Reset all settings. It
asks whatever speaks the game, the phone included, where a double tap does
what Enter does. It says what the measurement is for, and Enter starts it just
as the row does, and so does Escape. It cannot be skipped: it is needed once,
and the Speech calibration row can do it again later. It measures the first
speech.

### A second speech

The Speech tab has these rows: **Use second speech**, **First speech
settings**, **Second speech settings**, **Hints** and **Pause before hints**.
Enter on one of the two settings rows opens that speech's own page, and Escape
comes back to the row.

The first speech reads everything: the menus, the hints, Settings and the
pause menu. With **Use second speech** on (it is off by default), the second
speech reads what is read out during a game instead: the Extra mode's story
and its epilogue, the tutorial's lines, the game's announcements such as "New
weapons", and the challenge timer. So the game's text can have a voice of its
own, or a screen reader of its own, apart from the menus. With it off,
everything is read as before.

Each page starts with Speech output, then the voice, rate, rate boost, pitch
and volume while SAPI 5 speaks it (the system voice on the Mac; on the phone,
its Android speech engine, rate, pitch and volume). The first speech's page
then has Speech calibration. The second's has **Follow the first speech's
calibration**, and its own Speech calibration only while that is off. Test
speech is last on both. Second speech settings can be set up while Use second
speech is off, and each change is said in the second speech's voice.

Each speech has its own calibration, and the second's sentence is read in the
second speech's voice. Follow the first speech's calibration is on by default.
While it is on, the second speech uses the first's measurement, and
calibrating the first speech calibrates both. Turning it on puts the first's
measurement in place of the second's own; turning it off leaves the second
speech with that measurement until you calibrate it. The very first
calibration, the one the game asks for when it starts, turns it on. Changing a
voice keeps its speech's measurement. Each line is timed by the measurement of
the speech that reads it, and hints are always the first speech's.

The two speeches can speak at once. A screen reader that both of them use is
the same one, so their lines simply go to it. Two SAPI 5 voices are two
voices, each with its own settings, and a line cuts off only what its own
speech is saying; Use modern output, on the first speech's page, is for both
SAPI 5 voices. A key in the menus, and Control, stop only the first speech:
the second reads what is said during a game, and nothing stops it before it
has been heard. When both speeches use the same screen reader they are one
voice, and stopping it stops both. Reset all settings turns the second speech off
and puts its settings back.

On the Mac each speech's page lists **Automatic**, **VoiceOver** and **System
voice**: VoiceOver when it is on, the system voice when it is not, and the
system voice's own five rows — voice, rate, pitch and volume, with no rate
boost — in place of SAPI 5's. See [On the Mac](#on-the-mac).

Every screen the original offered a VoiceOver user is here, read in the
order VoiceOver read it, with the same labels and hints, and a good number of
places where the original said the wrong thing or nothing at all have been
fixed. They are all listed under *How faithful this is*.

## 3D sound

The game's sound is 3D: each zombie is heard from where it is, ahead of you,
behind you or to a side. That comes from an HRTF, a recording of how one head
hears a sound from every direction. Every head hears a little differently, so
one that makes ahead and behind clear for one player can blur them for
another.

**Settings → Sound → 3D sound** chooses which head the game hears with. It
changes at once and is kept with your settings; Reset all settings puts the
game's own back. **Test 3D sound** plays a steady sound once around you,
starting ahead and turning to your right, so you can compare them by ear.

Every choice plays at the game's own loudness. A set made with makemhr, or
OpenAL Soft's built-in, comes out about 14 dB louder than the game's own, so
the game turns it down to match: changing the 3D sound changes where sounds
seem to be, not how loud the zombies are against the rest of the game.

- **The game's own**, the default: the original game's, built from the set
  inside the original app.
- **OpenAL Soft's built-in**, on Windows and the Mac only: the one inside the
  sound library the game plays through. The phone has no OpenAL Soft, so it
  does not have this one.
- **Your own**: any `.mhr` file you add, listed under its file name.

No research set is built into the game. Each set has terms of its own, and you
bring the file under them.

### Your own 3D sound

**Step 1: get a set of recordings.** Research sets come as SOFA files
(`.sofa`). Many are gathered in the
[SOFA conventions database](https://sofacoustics.org/data/database/), a folder
per set. For example:

- `mit`: MIT's KEMAR dummy head, `mit_kemar_normal_pinna.sofa`, 1.1 MB. Free
  to use as long as its authors, Bill Gardner and Keith Martin of the MIT Media
  Lab, are credited.
- `listen (hrtf)`: IRCAM's LISTEN set, one file per listener, such as
  `IRC_1002_R_44100.sofa`, about 5 MB each.
- `sadie`: SADIE II from the University of York, twenty heads. Its own page,
  [SADIE II](https://www.york.ac.uk/sadie-project/database.html), gives it
  under the Apache 2.0 licence, which asks that the set is credited.

Read a set's terms before you give a file made from it to anyone else.

**Step 2, on Windows: let the game make it.** Put the `.sofa` file in the
`hrtf` folder in the game's own folder, next to `AudioDefence.exe`. The game
makes that folder when it first starts, and an update of the game leaves it
alone. Then start the game. Before the logo, it says it is making a 3D sound
from the file, and how far it has got every tenth of the way: MIT KEMAR takes
about 15 seconds, a large set a minute or two. Then it says the sound is ready,
and goes on to the logo. Escape skips it, and the file is made the next time
the game starts instead. In the 3D sound list it is under the file's name. A
file the game cannot make into a 3D sound is named, with the reason. A `.sofa`
you replace with a newer one is made again at the next start.

**Step 3: choose it** in **Settings → Sound → 3D sound**, and try it with
**Test 3D sound**.

**On the Mac and the phone,** the game cannot make a 3D sound itself: make the
`.mhr` on a Windows computer, as above or by hand as below, then add it.

- **Mac:** put the `.mhr` in the `hrtf` folder next to `AudioDefence.app`.
- **The phone:** Android lets the game read only the files it made itself, so
  a file cannot just be put in a folder. Copy the `.mhr` to the phone first, to
  the Download folder for example. Then choose **Settings → Sound → Add 3D
  sound file**: Android's own file picker opens, which TalkBack reads, not the
  game, so turn TalkBack on, choose the file, and turn TalkBack off again once
  you are back in the game. The game copies the file in and uses it at once.
  **Remove 3D sound file** takes the one in use out again. A backup (Export
  backup) holds your settings and progress, not these files: after a
  reinstall, add them again.

**Making the `.mhr` yourself.** The game does it with makemhr, OpenAL Soft's
tool, which it carries on Windows. The same tool is in this repository, in
`vendor\makemhr`: `makemhr.exe` with `zlib1.dll` beside it, from OpenAL Soft
1.25.2, unchanged, under the GNU GPL (its `README.txt` says more). The original
comes with OpenAL Soft's Windows download, `openal-soft-<version>-bin.zip`,
from [OpenAL Soft's website](https://openal-soft.org/) or its
[releases on GitHub](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/releases), in the
zip's `makemhr` folder. Keep the two files together. An `.mhr` is the same file
on every system, so one made on Windows works on the Mac and the phone too.

- **With the repository:** `py tools\make_3d_sounds.py` makes every `.sofa` in
  the `hrtf` folder into an `.mhr`, as the game does; name another folder after
  it to work there instead, or add `--all` to make them all again.
  Double-clicked, it works on the repository's own `hrtf` folder.
- **By hand,** in a Command Prompt in the folder with the `.sofa` file, where
  `C:\path\to\makemhr` is the folder makemhr is in:

      "C:\path\to\makemhr\makemhr.exe" -r 44100 -j 8 -i mit_kemar_normal_pinna.sofa -o "MIT KEMAR.mhr"

  `-r 44100` is the game's sample rate. `-j 8` lets makemhr use eight of the
  processor's threads, which makes it three times quicker than its own two.
  `-o` names the file, and that name is what the 3D sound list says. It ends
  with **Operation completed.** The KEMAR file comes to about 320 KB. Leave
  makemhr's other options as they are: the game takes up to 128 points per ear,
  which is the most OpenAL Soft takes too.

If a file cannot be used, because it is not an `.mhr` or it is damaged, the
game says so and keeps the 3D sound it had.

On a computer, OpenAL Soft uses the whole set. On the phone, the game's own
mixer uses only the directions at the height of your ears, as it does with the
game's own: every sound in the game is on the ground around you.

## Languages

The game can be played in another language. **Settings → Miscellaneous →
Language** chooses it, and the choice is kept with your other settings. English
is the default, and a player who never opens that row sees and hears exactly
what the port always showed.

**What stays English** is the recorded audio — the announcer calling out your
kills, and the game's own spoken lines. Those are sound files, not text, so no
translation can reach them.

### The language files

The languages are plain files in the `localization` folder next to
`AudioDefence.exe` — next to `AudioDefence.app` on the Mac. Each one is a list
of the game's English lines with the translation beside each, and any text
editor opens it. The Language row lists every file there by its name, whatever
the name is: `ru.json` is offered as *ru*, `Bahasa Melayu.json` as *Bahasa
Melayu*.

- **the game's own files** — the languages it comes with, and `template.json` —
  are kept as they were released. An update puts back one you have changed or
  deleted, and that is also how a translator's fixes reach you
- **to change a language for yourself**, copy its file and give the copy a name
  of your own that ends in `.json` — `ru.mine.json`, `Russian test.json`.
  Settings lists it beside the original, and updates never touch it. When the
  game gains lines, it adds them to your file the next time it starts, empty, so
  they are in English until you translate them; nothing you wrote is changed
- **to start a new language**, copy `template.json`, the empty list of every
  line, and name the copy after your language — `Deutsch.json`, `Bahasa
  Melayu.json`. At the top, fill in `"@plural"`: it says how your language
  counts, and [Words that change with a number](#words-that-change-with-a-number)
  shows what to write. Then translate as much as you like, in any order: an
  empty line stays English, so the file works from the first line, and you can
  choose it in Settings and hear it while you write it
- **to make it part of the game**, so every player has it and gets its fixes,
  send the file — as a pull request or an issue on GitHub, or to the developer.
  A few lines fixed are as welcome as a whole language

A file with a mistake in how it is written — a missing comma or quotation mark
— is left as it is, and choosing it plays the game in English; the game's log
says where the mistake is.

### Working on a language with the source

In a checkout, `localization/` is the repository's own folder, and three tools
look after it:

- `py tools/make_language.py`, with nothing after it, brings **every** language
  file in `localization/` up to date with the lines the port has, and writes
  `template.json` with them: a file keeps every translation, and only the new
  lines arrive empty. Name one file to do just that one, or to start a language
  under the name the Language row should give it —
  `py tools/make_language.py "Bahasa Melayu"`. Run it whenever the port gains
  text
- `py tools/merge_language.py FILE LANGUAGE` puts a file someone sent into the
  game's own — `py tools/merge_language.py "C:\Downloads\ru.json" ru`. Every
  line they translated goes in, in the place it already has, and each change is
  printed, as it was and as it is now; a line they left empty changes nothing. A
  name the game has no file of yet — `Deutsch` — makes one
- `py tools/verify_localization.py` fails if a phrase a player can reach is
  still English, so a language cannot quietly fall behind as the port grows. It
  skips `template.json`, unfinished by definition; ask for it by name —
  `--language template` — to see how far you have got

Every language file is written in the same order — `"@plural"`, then each line
sorted by its English — so a line is on the same line of every file, a fix
changes only its own line, and a new line lands where its English sorts rather
than at the end.

The `template.json` a translator writes in a checkout is never committed, and a
build does not ship it: a build writes its own, empty, beside the languages. A
language that lacks some of the port's lines has them added, empty, in the
build's copy, and the build names it, so that `make_language.py` can be run and
the result committed.

Nothing of any one language is in the game's code: what is particular to a
language is all in its own file. A line the port assembles from pieces is
translated piece by piece.

### Lines with a gap in them

Some lines have a gap the game fills in while you play: `%i` is a number, and
`%s` is a name or a word. The line comes to you whole, gap and all, with its
translation empty:

    "You need %i stars to play this level": ""

Write the whole sentence the way your language says it, and put the same gap
where the number belongs. The game fills it in:

    "You need %i stars to play this level": "Anda perlukan %i bintang untuk bermain tahap ini"

In the game: *Anda perlukan 19 bintang untuk bermain tahap ini.*

**Two gaps the other way round.** The gaps are filled in the order the English
has them. If your sentence needs them in another order, number each one by its
place in the English — `%1$s` is the first gap of the English line, `%2$s` the
second — and put them wherever your sentence wants them:

    "Version %s is available. You have %s.": "Anda ada versi %2$s. Versi %1$s sudah tersedia."

In the game: *Anda ada versi 1.1. Versi 1.2 sudah tersedia.*

### Words that change with a number

In English it is *1 star* but *2 stars*: the word changes with the number.
Languages do this in different ways — Russian has three forms of a word, Arabic
six, Malay none — so the game does not guess. You write every form of the word
between braces, with `|` between them, and the game picks the right one for each
number:

    "%i coins": "%i {монета|монеты|монет}"

In the game: *1 монета, 2 монеты, 5 монет, 21 монета.*

It takes three steps.

**1. Say how your language counts.** At the top of your file is `"@plural"`.
Find your language in this table and write the name from the first column there
— for Russian, `"@plural": "east-slavic"`.

| Write | For | Forms | Which numbers take which form, in order |
|---|---|---|---|
| `none` | Malay, Indonesian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese | 1 | The word never changes, so you need no braces at all |
| `one-other` | English, German, Dutch, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, Greek | 2 | 1 · every other number (0, 2, 3…) |
| `french` | French, Brazilian Portuguese | 2 | 0 and 1 · 2 and up |
| `east-slavic` | Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian | 3 | 1, 21, 31, 101… · 2–4, 22–24, 32–34… · 0, 5–20, 25–30… |
| `polish` | Polish | 3 | 1 only · 2–4, 22–24, 32–34… · 0, 5–21, 25–31… |
| `czech` | Czech, Slovak | 3 | 1 · 2–4 · 0, and 5 and up |
| `arabic` | Arabic | 6 | 0 · 1 · 2 · 3–10 · 11–99 · 100–102; past that, by the last two digits (103 as 3, 111 as 11) |

Capitals, spaces and small slips are forgiven: `East Slavic`, `east_slavic` and
even `east-slavik` are all read as `east-slavic`. Left empty, the file counts
the way English does. If your language is not in the table, choose the row that
counts the way it does; if none of them does, open an issue, and a row can be
added.

**2. Find the forms.** Say the word after a few numbers in your language — one
number from each group in the table, in order — and write down what you say:

- **Malay** (`none`): 1 bintang, 5 bintang. The word does not change, so write
  just `bintang`, with no braces
- **Spanish** (`one-other`): 1 estrella, 2 estrellas → `{estrella|estrellas}`
- **French** (`french`): 1 étoile, 2 étoiles → `{étoile|étoiles}`
- **Russian** (`east-slavic`): 1 звезда, 2 звезды, 5 звёзд →
  `{звезда|звезды|звёзд}`
- **Polish** (`polish`): 1 gwiazda, 2 gwiazdy, 5 gwiazd →
  `{gwiazda|gwiazdy|gwiazd}`

**3. Put the braces where the word goes in your sentence.** They can go
anywhere: they take the nearest number before them, or, if there is none
before, the first one after.

    "You need %i stars to play this level": "Necesitas %i {estrella|estrellas} para jugar este nivel"

In the game: *Necesitas 1 estrella para jugar este nivel*, *Necesitas 19
estrellas para jugar este nivel.*

**If something is wrong**, `py tools/verify_localization.py` tells you: a
`"@plural"` it does not know (and what you probably meant), or a line with more
or fewer forms than your language has. Nothing breaks in the game while you are
still writing — a line that is short of forms uses the last one it has.

## How this was made

This is a vibe-coded project, and it says so plainly because the method is the
interesting part.

Nobody had the source. What existed was the shipped iOS app: an arm64 binary,
its NIBs, its property lists, and 915 `.m4a` files. Everything in
`audiodefence/` was written by reading that binary method by method and writing
the Python next to it — **Claude (Opus 5, at its highest reasoning effort)** did
the reading and the writing, prompted by a human who cannot see the screen and
who tested every line of it by ear.

The rule was: copy what the game *does*, not what it ought to do. Its bugs
included. Every ported method carries the address it was written against, so any
line can be checked against the disassembly, and every deliberate departure is
written down with the address of the method it came from. That rule is for the
game itself; what the port adds to it is listed on its own, under *How faithful
this is*.

The toolchain that made it possible lives in `tools/` and its output in
`analysis/` — a disassembler, an Objective-C class and selector dump, a digest
view that condenses a method to its sends and branches, a NIB layout reader, a
resource lister, and an extractor for the HRTF that was embedded in the binary.
The game's own binaural impulse responses are in `assets/hrtf/`, which is why it
sounds like the original rather than like a generic 3D mixer.

Two lessons paid for in bugs, recorded here because they are the whole method in
miniature:

- A summary is not the source. The digest tool used to drop ARC lines, which hid
  every early `return` compiled as a tail call — and a wave ambience spent weeks
  muted because of it. Read the listing when control flow matters.
- The tester is the instrument. Several faults were only ever visible by ear:
  music that vanished for a whole round, a sound that played a metre short, an
  ambience that outlived the game that started it. None of them would have been
  found by reading code.

## Whose work this is

`game/` holds the original's own data and audio — the narration, the zombies,
the weapons, the music, the playlists that arrange them. That is **Somethin'
Else's work, not ours**. It is in the repository so the port can run and be
built from a clone, and a build made by `compiler.py` carries it too.

Nothing of theirs is claimed here, this project is not affiliated with them, and
if they want it taken down it comes down.

## Getting it

There are two ways to play, and only one of them needs Python.

**The built game** is on this repository's Releases page: a folder with
`AudioDefence.exe` in it, and the game's own data beside it. Unzip it and run
the executable — nothing to install, no Python, 64-bit Windows and a pair of
headphones. `readme.html` and `changelog.txt` are in the same folder.

You only have to do that once. From then on the game tells you when a new
version is out and installs it for you, downloading only the files that
changed — see [Updates](#updates) below.

**On the Mac** it is the same folder with `AudioDefence.app` in it instead, in
`AudioDefenceMac-<version>.zip` on the same release — see
[On the Mac](#on-the-mac).

**On Android** it is an app, `AudioDefence-Android-<version>.apk` on the same
release, built from this same repository — see [On Android](#on-android).

**From source** is everything below: the repository as it stands, run with the
Python you have. That is the one to take if you want to read the code, change
it, or build the executable yourself.

## Requirements

These are for running from source. A built game from Releases needs none of
them.

64-bit Python 3.14 on Windows. The simplest way to get it is the
**Python install manager** from
[python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/), which is what that site now
leads with: install it, then

    py install 3.14

and `py` is the command for everything below. A traditional python.org
installer works just as well — it brings `py` with it — so if you already have
Python, you have what you need.

Then the packages to play:

    py -m pip install pygame-ce numpy av comtypes prismatoid

| package | what needs it |
|---|---|
| `pygame-ce` | the window, the keyboard and the frame loop (`audiodefence/__main__.py`, `ui/`) |
| `numpy` | the audio maths: decoding, mixing, the Freeverb reverb (`s3d/`) |
| `av` (PyAV) | decodes the game's `.m4a` sounds (`s3d/decoder.py`) — without it no sound plays |
| `comtypes` | the SAPI 5 voice, used when no screen reader is running (`platform/speech.py`); skip it if you always play with NVDA |
| `prismatoid` | Prism, for speech through the screen readers other than NVDA — JAWS, ZoomText, System Access and the rest (`platform/speech.py`); it brings `cffi` with it. Without it those players hear the SAPI 5 voice instead; skip it if you always play with NVDA |

Nothing else is imported outside the standard library. OpenAL Soft
(`vendor/openal/soft_oal.dll`) and the NVDA controller client
(`vendor/nvda/nvdaControllerClient64.dll`) ship with the repository, so there
is nothing to install for either, and no system OpenAL is used.

One more package is needed only to redo the reverse engineering, never to play:

    py -m pip install capstone

| package | what needs it |
|---|---|
| `capstone` | the arm64 disassembler (`tools/disasm.py`, and `tools/extract_hrtf.py`) |

`numpy` and `av` are used by the tools as well — `numpy` by `tools/build_hrtf.py`
and `tools/reverb_calibrate.py`, `av` for the sound durations in
`tools/resources.py` — but you already have both for playing.

And one more only if you want to build an executable rather than run from
source (*Building an executable*, below):

    py -m pip install pyinstaller

## Running from source

    py AudioDefence.py

That is the whole story: the logo, the opener, then the main menu. The launcher
can be double-clicked, and it takes the options below:

    py AudioDefence.py --endless
    py AudioDefence.py --challenge tutorial_1
    py AudioDefence.py --help

Settings, saves and the log live in `%APPDATA%\AudioDefence` (on the Mac,
`~/Library/Application Support/AudioDefence`), in three files:

| file | what is in it |
|---|---|
| `save.json` | progress: coins, diamonds, weapons, power-ups, missions, challenges, statistics |
| `settings.json` | control scheme, button mode, turn sensitivity, menu arrows, cursor memory, tutorial text, the announcer, the game volume, menu music volume, the update check and a version you skipped, how strong the vibration and the trigger feel are, and whether hints name keys or controller buttons, and which controller's, the speech output and SAPI 5's voice, rate, rate boost, pitch and volume, whether hints are read and the pause before them, whether the second speech is used and its own output, voice, rate, rate boost, pitch and volume, whether it follows the first speech's calibration, and how fast each speech was measured to read, the 3D sound; on the phone, each speech's engine, the shake sensitivity and how strongly the phone vibrates too |
| `keys.json` | the key bindings, and each kind of controller's, by its name |

Deleting the folder starts a fresh profile — the first run then begins on Gyro
with the default key bindings.

Two rows of **Settings → Miscellaneous** work on these files:

- **Open game data folder** opens the folder in File Explorer, or in the Finder
  on the Mac. Close the game before you put files into it, or it writes its own
  over them as it closes.
- **Clear all saves** starts the game again from nothing, after asking, with No
  first: your coins, diamonds, weapons, power-ups, missions, challenges and
  their stars, statistics and Endless high score go, and your settings and
  buttons stay. The main menu then opens on the fresh start. It is not offered
  in the pause screen.

## On the Mac

The Mac build is the same port — the same engine, the same game data, the same
OpenAL Soft and the game's own HRTF — with the Mac's own speech, folders and
app. Nothing in the game itself asks which it is on:
`audiodefence/platform/host.py` holds every choice that differs.

| | Windows | Mac |
|---|---|---|
| the game | `AudioDefence.exe`, with `game/` beside it | `AudioDefence.app`, with the game's data inside it |
| speech | NVDA, the other screen readers through Prism, SAPI 5 | VoiceOver, then the system voice |
| settings, saves, log | `%APPDATA%\AudioDefence` | `~/Library/Application Support/AudioDefence` |
| OpenAL Soft | `vendor/openal/soft_oal.dll` | `vendor/openal-mac/libopenal.dylib` |
| release zip | `AudioDefence-Win-<version>.zip` | `AudioDefenceMac-<version>.zip` |
| leaving the game | Alt+F4, or Quit | Cmd+Q, or Quit |

### Playing the built game

Unzip `AudioDefenceMac-<version>.zip` and move the `AudioDefence` folder
somewhere of your own — your Applications folder will do — then open
`AudioDefence.app` in it. The app is not signed with an Apple developer
certificate, so the first time macOS refuses to open it: open **System
Settings → Privacy & Security**, and choose **Open Anyway** for AudioDefence
near the bottom. You only do that once. It runs on Apple silicon Macs.

Move the folder before you first open the game. An app opened where it was
downloaded is run by macOS from a temporary copy, and from there it cannot
update itself; it tells you so if you ask it to.

### VoiceOver

With VoiceOver on, the game speaks through it, in your own voice and at your
own rate, and a braille display shows the same lines. It speaks to VoiceOver
by AppleScript, which VoiceOver allows only when asked to: in **VoiceOver
Utility → General**, tick **Allow VoiceOver to be controlled with
AppleScript**. The first time the game speaks, macOS asks whether
AudioDefence may control VoiceOver — say OK. Until both are done the game
still speaks, as announcements VoiceOver reads while the game's window has
focus, but they can be cut short by VoiceOver's own speech.

VoiceOver's Quick Nav takes the arrow keys for itself, and the game needs
them: if the arrows seem to do nothing, press Left and Right arrow together to
turn Quick Nav off.

With VoiceOver off, the game speaks with the system voice — the one set in
**System Settings → Accessibility → Spoken Content** — and each speech's page
in the Speech tab lists its voice, rate, pitch and volume, as it lists SAPI
5's on Windows. The second speech has a system voice of its own.

In the menus Command works as Control does with the arrows: Command with the
menu's arrows goes to the first or last element, and with the other pair to
the first or last tab.

### Running from source

The Mac uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for Python and the packages,
which the repository's `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` pin:

    brew install uv
    uv run AudioDefence.py

`uv run` makes `.venv` with the right Python and packages the first time; the
options are the same as on Windows. `pygame-ce`, `numpy` and `av` are the same
three, `pyobjc-framework-cocoa` takes the place of `comtypes` and
`prismatoid` for speech, and PyInstaller comes with them for building.
`AudioDefence.command` can be double-clicked in Finder to do the same.

### Building the app

    uv run compiler.py

or double-click `compiler.command`. It is the same compiler with the same
menu and flags, less the one-file builds, which on a Mac would unpack itself
on every launch. It leaves `dist/AudioDefence` holding `AudioDefence.app`,
readme.html, changelog.txt and license.txt, and zips it into
`dist/AudioDefenceMac-<version>.zip`, keeping the app's links and execute
bits so Finder unzips a working app. The game's data goes inside the app, at
`Contents/Resources/game`, less the original's iOS executable and its code
signature, and the app is signed again, ad hoc, once it is complete.

Put the Mac zip on the same release as the Windows one, in either order. Each
build's updater takes the zip made for it, by its name. Keep the names exactly
as the compiler makes them. GitHub lists a release's files alphabetically,
not in the order they were uploaded, and a Windows build from before the Mac
port takes the first zip it finds. `AudioDefence-Win-` sorts before
`AudioDefenceMac-` because a dash comes before any letter. A Mac zip called
`AudioDefence-Mac-` would come first, and those older Windows builds would
install it over themselves.

`vendor/openal-mac/libopenal.dylib` is OpenAL Soft 1.25.2 built for arm64,
the same version as the Windows DLL. `tools/build_openal_mac.sh` rebuilds it
from source (it needs cmake and the Xcode command line tools), for an Intel
Mac with `--arch x86_64`.

## On Android

The Android app is the same port again — the same game code and the same game
data, taken from this repository when the app is built — run inside the app by
[Chaquopy](https://chaquo.com/chaquopy/). What a phone does differently lives
in `android/` and in the `_android` modules beside their desktop ones:

| | Windows and the Mac | Android |
|---|---|---|
| sound | OpenAL Soft, with the game's own HRTF | a small mixer of the app's own, in Java, with the same HRTF |
| speech | the screen reader, or the system voice | the phone's own text-to-speech; TalkBack has to be off |
| controls | the keyboard, or a game controller | touch and gestures; no game controllers yet |
| updates | from inside the game, only the files that changed | from inside the game, the whole app, installed by Android |

### Installing it

Copy `AudioDefence-Android-<version>.apk` from the latest release to the phone
and open it; Android asks to allow installing from that source the first time,
and Play Protect may warn that the app is not from the Play Store — install it
anyway. It needs a 64-bit phone (arm64) with Android 8 or later.

From then on the game updates itself, as it does on a computer — see
[Updates](#updates).

**Turn TalkBack off before you open the game.** The game speaks for itself, and
TalkBack would take the touches for its own; if it is on, the game says so.
The first start unpacks the game's data, saying how far it has got; that takes
a minute or two, and later starts are quick. After an update, only the files
the update changed are unpacked: usually there are none or a few, and the game
starts straight away. When there are more, the game says it is unpacking the
update, and says how far it has got when there are a lot.

The game speaks with the text-to-speech engine set in the phone's settings. To
use another engine installed on the phone, choose it in the Android speech
engine row of First speech settings, in the Speech tab in Settings. Each
engine speaks with the voice set in its own settings on the phone, so a voice
is chosen there, not in the game; the rate, pitch and volume rows below the
engine row work with whichever engine speaks. A rate of 0 is the speed set in the phone's text-to-speech settings,
and 10 is six times that, as far as the engine allows. The second speech has
an engine, rate, pitch and volume of its own, in Second speech settings; the
phone starts it only once it has something to say.

### Your progress on the phone

The game keeps its files inside the app, where no other app or file manager can
reach them, so **Settings → Miscellaneous** has these rows in place of Open game
data folder:

- **Export backup** puts your progress, settings and buttons in one file,
  `AudioDefence backup.zip`, in the **AudioDefence** folder in **Documents**.
  Each export replaces the last. Nothing is sent anywhere.
- **Import backup** asks first, puts the backup in place of your progress,
  settings and buttons, and closes the game; start it again to play with the
  backup. It reads the file straight from that folder, as long as the game has
  not been uninstalled since the export. Android shows an app only the files
  it made itself, and none once it has been uninstalled, so after a reinstall,
  or on another phone, the game opens Android's own file picker instead and says
  so. That screen is Android's, not the game's: turn TalkBack on, choose
  `AudioDefence backup.zip` in the AudioDefence folder in Documents, and turn
  TalkBack off again once you are back in the game. On Android 8 and 9 both
  rows use the picker. Import is not offered in the pause screen.
- **Clear all saves**, as on a computer.

The backup is the three files a computer keeps, zipped: unzipped into the game
data folder on a computer, it carries your progress over, and a computer's
three files zipped together can be imported on the phone. The game makes no
backup in the cloud: uninstalling it deletes its files, so export a backup
first. A 3D sound file of your own is not in the backup: add it again after a
reinstall (see [Your own 3D sound](#your-own-3d-sound)).

### Controls on the phone

Hold the phone sideways; the whole screen is the touch area. The touches are
the original's own, as it was played with VoiceOver running: in the menus
VoiceOver's gestures, and in a game the gestures the original's game view took.

| in the menus | |
|---|---|
| swipe right or left | the next or previous item |
| swipe up or down | a slider up or down, or the next or previous tab or category where the screen has them |
| double tap | press the item |
| double tap and hold | a row's second action |
| two-finger scrub (two fingers back and forth, like a Z), or the phone's Back | back |
| two-finger tap | stop speaking |
| two-finger swipe up | read the whole screen from the top |
| two-finger swipe down | read the screen from the item you are on |
| four-finger tap near the top or bottom | the first or last item |

In a game, Settings → Controls chooses between two modes, as the original did.

| in a game | Gesture mode | Button mode |
|---|---|---|
| tap | one shot | the corner you tap: top right fires, top left melee, bottom left next weapon, bottom right reload |
| touch and hold | continuous fire with the automatic weapons | continuous fire, in the top right corner |
| one-finger swipe up | next weapon | nothing |
| one-finger swipe down | reload | nothing |
| three-finger tap | melee | nothing |
| a shake | melee — how hard a shake has to be is Shake sensitivity, in Settings → Controls | nothing |
| a finger moved sideways | turns, when the aiming is set to Swipe; Gyro and Tilt use the phone's sensors | the same |
| the Pause button, at the top of the screen in the middle | touch it and it is read; double tap it to pause | the same |
| the phone's Back | pause | the same |

In a challenge, Skip dialogue is the first button on the pause screen while
there is a line to skip: one of Dr. Bastard's, or a part of the Extra mode's
story. In the intro, a triple tap with one finger skips it.

A keyboard or a game controller paired with the phone, or plugged into it,
works as it does on a computer: the same keys and buttons, set in **Settings →
Keyboard** and **Settings → Joystick**, in the menus and in a game, and the
phone says when a controller comes or goes. See
[With a game controller](#with-a-game-controller) for what its buttons do. In
the menus the arrows and the D-pad move as the swipes do: left and right through
the items, up and down through the tabs. The turn keys and the sticks turn on
top of the phone's own turning under Gyro and Tilt. While you use the keyboard,
the hints name its keys; a touch on the screen brings back the touches. A
controller that can vibrate does, as on a computer; on Android 12 and later
each of its two motors is reached, and before that the phone gives it one. A
DualSense's trigger feel and fine haptics, and shaking a controller for melee,
are only on a computer: Android does not give the game those.

The phone vibrates with the game, for what a controller vibrates for: the
heartbeat, hits, kills, explosions, the tornado, your death, and a click as you
move through the menus. **Settings → Miscellaneous → Phone vibration** sets how
strongly: Off, Light, Medium (the default) or Strong. A phone with haptics feels
each one as hard as it is, and the menus click with the phone's own clicks where
it has them. A phone with plain vibration only buzzes, a lighter setting more
briefly. The row is not there on a phone with nothing to vibrate. Android's own
vibration setting for media has to be on, in the phone's Sound and vibration
settings.

### Building the app

Everything here is done once, on Windows, in a command prompt, with an internet
connection and about 5 GB free. Nothing needs Android Studio. Steps 1 to 4
are the downloads and installs, done by hand; the two tools in steps 5 and 6
do the rest. [What gets downloaded](#what-gets-downloaded), below, lists every
download, and how to do the setup tool's part by hand too.

**1. Python 3.13, for the build.** The game runs on Python 3.14, but the app
carries a Python of its own inside it, and Chaquopy, which puts it there, has
to find that same version on the computer that builds it. 3.13 is the newest
one Chaquopy has numpy for. It installs beside 3.14, and neither gets in the
other's way:

    py install 3.13

`py -0` then lists both. Or from the website: on
[python.org's Windows page](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/), take
the Windows installer (64-bit) of the newest 3.13 release and run it.

**2. Java 21.** Either way:

- **From the website:** on Adoptium's
  [release page](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/), choose the **LTS**
  version, **21**, for **Windows**, **x64**, the **JDK**, and download the
  `.msi` installer and run it. On the page that lists what to install, set
  **Set JAVA_HOME variable** to **Will be installed on local hard drive** —
  it is off unless you do.
- **With winget:**

      winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.21.JDK

In a new command prompt, `java -version` says 21. Java 17 works too, but
nothing newer than 23: Gradle 8.13 does not run on it.

**3. The Android command-line tools.** On
[developer.android.com/studio](https://developer.android.com/studio), find
**Command line tools only** and download the zip for Windows. Make the folder
`C:\Android\cmdline-tools`, unzip the download into it, and rename the folder
it makes, `cmdline-tools`, to `latest` — so that
`C:\Android\cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat` exists.

**4. Gradle 8.13.** From [gradle.org/releases](https://gradle.org/releases/),
download **v8.13, binary-only**. Make the folder `C:\Android\Gradle` and unzip
it there. The zip holds one folder, `gradle-8.13`, which keeps its name, so
that `C:\Android\Gradle\gradle-8.13\bin\gradle.bat` exists. (Gradle unzipped
into `C:\Gradle`, or on your Path, is found as well.)

**5. The rest of the setup.** In a new command prompt, in the repository's
folder:

    py tools\android_setup.py

It checks steps 1 to 4 and says which is missing; sets `ANDROID_HOME`;
accepts the Android SDK's licences and downloads the parts the app is built
with; and runs a first build, a test build and then a release, which
downloads Gradle's own parts and takes ten to twenty minutes. Before each
download it says what it is and roughly how big. Each step is said as it
goes, and a summary at the end says what is ready and what is left. Run it
again whenever you like: it skips what is done.

**6. The signing key.**

    py tools\android_keys.py

lists the keys in `C:\Android\Keys`, makes a new one — it asks for a name,
**release** if you just press Enter — and chooses the one the compiler
offers. See [A release](#a-release) for keeping it safe.

**7. Build.** In a new command prompt, double-click `compiler.py` and choose
**Android build** (or type `py compiler.py --android`) — see
[Building an executable](#building-an-executable). It asks where your signing
key is: Enter takes the one from step 6. It leaves the app in `dist`, and
takes a minute or two. Once step 5's first build is done, the compiler runs
Gradle offline (`--offline`), so building downloads nothing. If Gradle then
finds a part missing — after trying a newer version, say — the compiler
stops and says so: run `py tools\android_setup.py` again, which downloads
it, and build again.

**8. Onto the phone.** Copy the APK from `dist` to the phone and open it there
— see [Installing it](#installing-it). Or connect the phone with a USB cable
and type

    py tools\android_setup.py --phone

which installs the newest APK in `dist` over the app already there, keeping
its progress. If it cannot see the phone, it says what to switch on in the
phone's settings first.

#### A release

A release is signed with the app's own key, the same one every time, or phones
refuse to install it over the one they have. A build without a key is a test
build, signed with a key Android makes for each computer instead: it cannot
install over a release, nor a release over it.

Keep the key safe: back it up somewhere private, never in the repository, and
hand it on with the project. Every release has to be signed with it, or
phones will not install it over the one they have. Git leaves out any key
file put in the repository by mistake (`.p12`, `.jks` and `.keystore`).

The compiler asks where the key is whenever its choice makes the APK — Enter
takes the one `AD_KEYSTORE` names, which `android_keys.py` sets, or the only
key in `C:\Android\Keys` — and typed out, `--key` and the path does the same.
A key made some other way, with its own alias and passwords, needs them in
`AD_KEY_ALIAS`, `AD_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD` and `AD_KEY_PASSWORD` as well.

With the key, the compiler's release build — or its Android build — signs the
app and leaves it at `dist\AudioDefence-Android-<version>.apk`, the version
being the one in `VERSION`. Without the key, the release build makes no APK
and says why, and the Android build makes a test one,
`AudioDefence-Android-<version>-TEST.apk`. Attach the release's APK to the
GitHub release beside the Windows and Mac zips: that is the file the app looks
for when it updates itself. The app's version comes from `VERSION` as it is
built — its name is the tag, and the number Android compares is the same
digits run together, `26.10.01-1` being 26100101 — so every release is newer
to Android than the one before. Without the compiler, `gradle assembleDebug`
— or `assembleRelease`, with `AD_KEYSTORE` set — in the `android` folder
leaves the app under `android\app\build\outputs\apk`. Gradle closes when a
build ends, so it does not stay in memory or lock its folder.

### What gets downloaded

Each of these is downloaded once. After the first build, building the app
downloads nothing: the compiler runs Gradle offline. Building for Windows
downloads nothing at all.

| What | Size, about | Who downloads it | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| Python 3.13 | 120 MB installed | you, step 1 | once |
| Java 21, the Temurin JDK | 330 MB installed | you, step 2 | once |
| the Android command-line tools | 170 MB unzipped | you, step 3 | once |
| Gradle 8.13 | 150 MB unzipped | you, step 4 | once |
| Android platform 35 and build-tools 35.0.0 | a 125 MB download, 270 MB installed | sdkmanager, which the setup tool runs | once |
| platform-tools, which holds adb | an 8 MB download, 17 MB installed | sdkmanager, which the setup tool runs, or you | once; only `--phone` uses it |
| Gradle's own parts: the Android Gradle plugin, Chaquopy and Python for Android | a 120 MB download, 360 MB once Gradle has unpacked it, in `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle` | Gradle, in the setup tool's first build | the first build only |
| numpy, for the app's Python | a few MB | pip, which Chaquopy runs in that build | the first test build and the first release |

numpy is pip's to download, not Gradle's, so offline does not reach it: it
is kept in `android\app\build`, and downloaded again only if that folder is
deleted or the app's Python changes.

#### Doing it by hand

Steps 1 to 4 are by hand already, each with its link and the folder it goes
in. The setup tool's downloads can be done by hand too.

**The Android SDK's parts.** sdkmanager, from step 3, downloads them. These
are the lines the setup tool runs, typed in a command prompt:

    C:\Android\cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager --licenses
    C:\Android\cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager platforms;android-35 build-tools;35.0.0 platform-tools

The first asks you to accept each of the Android SDK's licences: type `y` and
press Enter for each. sdkmanager installs nothing until they are accepted.
The second puts the platform in `C:\Android\platforms\android-35`, the build
tools in `C:\Android\build-tools\35.0.0`, and platform-tools in
`C:\Android\platform-tools`. Then tell the build where they are, as the setup
tool does, and open a new command prompt:

    setx ANDROID_HOME C:\Android

**platform-tools from the website.** platform-tools, which only `--phone`
needs, can come from Google's page instead:
[developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools).
Download SDK Platform-Tools for Windows. The zip holds one folder,
`platform-tools`, which keeps its name: unzip it into `C:\Android`, so that
`C:\Android\platform-tools\adb.exe` exists. Either way works.

**Gradle's own parts cannot be downloaded by hand.** The build works out
which of some 350 library files it needs as it goes, so only a build fetches
them: the setup tool's first build, or `gradle assembleDebug assembleRelease`
typed in the `android` folder. They stay in `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle` from then
on.

#### When everything is in place

Each folder, and the one file in it that shows it is right:

- `C:\Android\cmdline-tools\latest`, with `bin\sdkmanager.bat`
- `C:\Android\Gradle\gradle-8.13`, with `bin\gradle.bat`
- `C:\Android\platforms\android-35`, with `android.jar`
- `C:\Android\build-tools\35.0.0`, with `aapt2.exe`
- `C:\Android\platform-tools`, with `adb.exe`, only for `--phone`
- `C:\Android\licenses`, with `android-sdk-license`
- `C:\Android\Keys`, with your key from step 6, `release.p12` unless you
  named it otherwise
- `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\caches\modules-2\files-2.1\com.chaquo.python`, a
  folder the first build leaves: while it is there, the compiler builds
  offline

And in a new command prompt, `py -0` lists 3.13, `java -version` says 21,
and `echo %ANDROID_HOME%` says `C:\Android`.

### Trying newer versions

Every version the build uses is set in one place. To try a newer one,
change it there, build with the compiler's **Android build** (choice 2), and
play the test APK on a phone before making a release with it. To go back,
put the line back as it was. A newer version of anything Gradle fetches is a
new download, so the compiler, building offline, stops and says a part is
missing: run `py tools\android_setup.py`, which downloads it, and build
again.

**The app's Python.** One line in `android/app/build.gradle`,
`def appPython = '3.13'`; the compiler and the setup tool read it from there.
It cannot be 3.14 yet only because the app needs numpy, and nobody has built
numpy for Android on 3.14. To see whether that has changed, look on
[Chaquopy's numpy page](https://chaquo.com/pypi-13.1/numpy/) for a file with
both `cp314` and `arm64_v8a` in its name. Or simply try it: change the line to
`'3.14'`, install Python 3.14 if you have not, and build. If numpy is still
missing, the build stops at installing it and says so.

**Java.** `JAVA_RANGE = (17, 23)` in `compiler.py`, which the compiler and
the setup tool check Java against. The limit is Gradle: 8.13 runs on nothing
newer than Java 23. Java 24 needs Gradle 8.14 or later, and Java 25 Gradle
9.1 or later, which may in turn need a newer Android Gradle plugin. Install
the newer JDK, point `JAVA_HOME` at it, raise the 23, and unzip a Gradle that
runs on it. To go back, point `JAVA_HOME` at Java 21 again.

**Gradle.** Whichever is unzipped in `C:\Android\Gradle`: the tools take the
newest `gradle-` folder there. Unzip the newer one beside `gradle-8.13`; to go
back, delete it. The limit is the Android Gradle plugin: each version names the
oldest Gradle it runs on, 8.13 for plugin 8.13, and a much newer Gradle may
need a newer plugin.

**The Android platform and build tools.** `compileSdk 35` and
`buildToolsVersion '35.0.0'` in `android/app/build.gradle`. The compiler and
the setup tool read both from there, and the setup tool downloads what they
name, so after changing them run `py tools\android_setup.py` before you
build. The limit is the Android Gradle plugin: a platform newer than the
plugin may need a newer plugin. `targetSdk 34`, beside them, is different: it is the
version of Android whose rules the app follows on a phone, so raising it
changes how the app behaves there. Try that one with the phone in hand.

**Chaquopy and the Android Gradle plugin.** Their versions are in
`android/build.gradle`: `id 'com.chaquo.python' version '17.0.0'` and
`id 'com.android.application' version '8.13.0'`. Chaquopy 17.0 works with
Python 3.10 to 3.14 and the Android Gradle plugin 7.3 to 9.2. A newer plugin
may need a newer Gradle and Java, as above.

## Controls

In the menus, the port stands in for VoiceOver: it reads the elements of a
screen the way VoiceOver reads them, with their labels, hints and "button".

| key | what it does in the menus |
|---|---|
| Right / Tab | next element |
| Left / Shift+Tab | previous element |
| Ctrl+Right / Ctrl+Left, Ctrl+Tab / Ctrl+Shift+Tab, End / Home | last / first element |
| Down / Up | next / previous tab or category |
| Ctrl+Down / Ctrl+Up | last / first tab or category |
| Enter | activate |
| Shift+Enter | a row's second action, where it has one |
| Escape / Backspace | back |
| Page Up / Page Down | menu music louder / quieter |

Hold a key that moves one element — the arrows, Tab or Shift+Tab — and it
repeats, so a long list can be walked through without tapping. It starts
repeating after about a third of a second. Nothing else repeats: a jump to an
end has nowhere to go, Enter must act once, and a key held in a game belongs to
the game.

In a game, these are the defaults; all of them can be rebound in
**Settings → Keyboard**, and "Restore default keys" puts them back.

| key | what it does in a game |
|---|---|
| Space | fire: tap for a single shot, hold for continuous fire |
| Left Ctrl or Right Ctrl | melee |
| W, or Up arrow under Gesture | next weapon |
| R, or Down arrow under Gesture | reload |
| Left / Right arrow | turn |
| Escape | pause: Resume, Restart challenge (in a challenge), End Game |
| Enter | skip the narration: Dr. Bastard's lines, and the Extra mode's story |
| T | read the challenge timer |

Those two follow the control scheme, because the scheme changes what the action
is. Under **Gesture** you are swiping: up switches weapon, down reloads, and
the arrows stand for the swipes. Under **Button** you are pressing the four
corner buttons, where nothing is directional, so they are letters — W and R.
Rebinding either one changes it for the scheme you are in and leaves the other
alone; the rest of the keys are one binding for both.

An action can hold more than one key. On a binding row, **Enter** adds a key,
**Shift+Enter** replaces every key that action has, and **Delete** removes the
one you added last — an action is never left with no key at all. Key names are
spoken the way people say them, so the two Enter keys are "Enter" and "Numpad
Enter".

The arrows that move through a screen are a setting: Left and Right by
default, or Up and Down if you prefer them, in **Settings → Miscellaneous → Menu
arrows**. Whichever pair you choose, Ctrl with it jumps to the first or last
element, and Tab, Shift+Tab, Home and End work either way.

The other pair changes tab. In the armory, Down and Up step through Weapons,
Loadout and Powerup without walking to the bottom of the list first,
and each one is named before it reads what you land on; Settings opens straight
inside **Aiming**, and the same two keys move it to Controls, Sound, Keyboard
and Miscellaneous — there is no list of categories to go through first. Choose Up and Down
for moving through a screen and the two swap over, so the tabs land on Left and
Right. Ctrl with the tab pair jumps to the first or last tab, exactly as Ctrl
with the other pair jumps to the first or last element; Tab stays with the
elements, so Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab jump to the last and first element
from wherever you are. The ends hold rather than wrap, as everywhere else.

Settings speaks every change and clicks like the original's buttons. Escape
leaves it; the turn sensitivity and the key bindings live in Aiming and
Keyboard. **Settings → Miscellaneous → Reset all settings** puts every setting
back to how a new profile starts, except your key bindings, which Keyboard has
its own Restore default keys for. Quit is on the main menu.

### With a game controller

A controller works in the menus and in play: a DualSense, a DualShock 4, an
Xbox or Switch Pro controller, or most others Windows recognises. Plug it in
before or after starting the game; it says so when one connects or goes. The
buttons are named as your controller names them — Cross and R2 on a
PlayStation pad, A and RT on an Xbox one.

In the menus it stands in for the keys:

| controller | what it does in the menus |
|---|---|
| D-pad or either stick | the arrows: move through the screen, and change tab on the other pair |
| Cross (A) | Enter: activate |
| Square (X) | Shift+Enter: a row's second action |
| Circle (B) | Escape: back |
| L1 / R1 | previous / next row, without reaching for the D-pad |
| Cross (A) held, with a direction or L1 / R1 | the first or last row, or the first or last tab |
| L2 / R2 | menu music quieter / louder |
| Triangle (Y) | Delete, on a key binding row |

In a game:

| controller | what it does in a game |
|---|---|
| either stick, sideways | turn — a small push turns slowly, all the way as fast as the arrow keys |
| D-pad left / right | turn, at the same speed as the arrow keys (Alternate turn left / right — the only turning you can rebind) |
| R2 | fire |
| R1 | melee |
| L1, or a stick flicked up or D-pad up under Gesture | next weapon |
| L2, or a stick flicked down or D-pad down under Gesture | reload |
| Options | pause, and Options again to resume |
| Cross (A) | skip the narration: Dr. Bastard's lines, and the Extra mode's story |
| Square | read the challenge timer |

Under **Gesture** a stick flicked up or down is the swipe, as the Up and Down
arrows are on the keyboard; a stick pushed more sideways than up or down only
turns, so turning does not switch weapons by accident. Shaking the controller
is shaking the phone: under Gesture it swings your melee weapon, as it did in
the original, and under Button it does nothing, as it did not. It needs a pad
that can feel movement — a DualSense, a DualShock 4 or a Switch Pro.

A controller that can vibrate lets you feel the game:

- the **heartbeat** when a zombie is close, on every beat and harder the closer
  it is;
- a **hit**, as hard as it hurt: a big gun's hit is felt more than a small
  one's, a melee blow is a heavier thud, and several hits at once are firmer
  still. A shot the Shield zombie's shield takes is a light knock, and a miss
  is felt as nothing;
- a **kill**, whatever did it;
- an **explosion** — a Farty going off, a rocket, a power-up's blast — harder
  the closer it is, and the zombies it hurts;
- the tornado's **gust** pushing the zombies back;
- and **your own death**, a long heavy rumble when a zombie gets you.

A **DualSense on USB** goes further: its grips play the game's own heartbeat —
the very recording you hear, felt in your hands — and its own knocks, thuds
and rumbles for the rest, through the fine haptics PlayStation games use rather
than plain rumble. Over Bluetooth Windows does not offer that, and it rumbles
like any other pad. On a **DualSense** the triggers change too while you play:
R2 is shaped like a pistol's trigger: a long take-up with nothing in it, then
the wall, where it holds; pressing through the wall breaks it and the shot goes
at the break, not when you first meet it. Letting it back out to just under the
wall is the reset, and it fires again from there, so you can shoot without
letting go all the way. Under Button, L2 pulls against a light spring where it
reloads. In the menus and on the pause
screen they are plain again, and they are set back when the game closes.

**Settings → Miscellaneous → Fine haptics** (on by default) chooses how a
controller that has both plays what you feel: through the fine haptics in its
grips, or through its motors like any other pad. Turn it off to feel a
DualSense as an ordinary controller. With no such controller connected, the
motors are used whatever it says.

**Settings → Miscellaneous** sets how strong **Joystick vibration** and the
**Trigger feel** are: Off, Light, Medium (the default) or Strong, with Enter
for the next and Shift+Enter for the previous. Each step of Joystick vibration
gives a pulse at the new strength so you can feel it, and each step of the
Trigger feel puts that feel on the triggers for eight seconds so you can
squeeze R2 and try it there and then. The Trigger feel is only for a
DualSense — no other controller has one.

**Settings → Joystick** names the controller that is connected, and lets you
change which button does what, the way Keyboard does for keys:
Enter (Cross) on an action
adds a button, Shift+Enter (Square) replaces them all, Delete (Triangle)
removes the last one, and Escape on the keyboard cancels. Next weapon and
Reload are set for the control scheme you are in, as on the keyboard. A stick
pushed sideways cannot be bound — it turns — and neither can the PS or Xbox
button, which Windows or Steam often keeps. Each kind of controller keeps its
own buttons, by the name it gives itself — a DualSense's, a DualShock 4's, an
Xbox pad's — made from the defaults the first time it is connected, so setting
up one never changes another. With two or more kinds connected, the
**Controller** row says which one's buttons are listed ("DualSense Wireless
Controller, 1 of 2"), and Enter or Shift+Enter goes to the next or previous.
**Restore default buttons** puts that controller's buttons back, and Reset all
settings leaves them alone. With no controller connected the buttons are not
listed. If Steam is running it
may take the controller over and present it as an Xbox pad; the game still
works, but for your own controller's button names, turn Steam Input off for
the game.

**Settings → Miscellaneous → Names in hints and tutorial** chooses whether the
hints and the tutorial text name the keyboard's keys (the default) or the
connected controller's buttons, as that controller calls them: "Press Cross to
copy the results", "use the R2 button to fire your weapon" on a PlayStation
pad, "Press A" and "RT" on an Xbox one. Enter or Shift+Enter switches it. So do
the other lines that name a key: the tab and category keys ("L1 and R1 change
tab, D-pad left and right move through it"), the Button and Gesture rows, and
"Press Cross to skip intro". With two or more kinds of controller connected,
**Controller for names** under it chooses which one. With no controller
connected the row is dimmed and it is Keyboard keys: starting the game without
one, or unplugging the last one wherever you are, sets it back to Keyboard keys
and saves that, so choose Controller buttons again when you next play with one.

## Sharing a result

Every screen at the end of a run has a **Copy results** button, read straight
after the results and before the screen's other buttons: after an endless game,
after a challenge you completed, and after one you failed. It puts a short list
on the clipboard as
plain text, ready to paste into a message, and says "Results copied to
clipboard." After an Endless game it looks like this:

    Audio Defence Endless Statistics

    Tarot cards: Electric Shield, Zombies With Helmets! and Lucky Shot
    Coins Earned: 7802
    Diamonds Earned: 14
    Score: 11882144
    Kills: 162
    Accuracy: 76.53 %
    Survival time: 17:04
    Maximum combo: 483

After a challenge the heading is *Audio Defence Challenge Statistics*, then the
challenge's name and whether you completed or failed it, then the stars,
rewards and statistics that screen shows. There are no tarot cards in a
challenge.

The lines are taken from the screen itself rather than worked out again: each
results screen reads exactly these lines, one row each, and only the heading is
not on it, since the screen has its own title. The game's version is never in
it. The original had one way to share a score, a Twitter sheet, which needed an
account and an iPhone; this needs neither.

The failed screen used to tell you nothing at all — the original shows a tip,
and two buttons. It now reads your results first, the same kills, accuracy and
time the completed screen shows, so a run you lost can be compared with one you
won, and so the copy is not handing you figures you were never told. The tip
follows them.

## Updates

The game keeps itself up to date. When the main menu opens it asks GitHub
whether there is a newer build, and says nothing at all unless there is one —
if there is, it tells you the version and gives you three answers. **Yes**
downloads it. **No** means not now: the next time the game starts, it asks
again. **Skip this version** means not this one: that build is not offered
again when the game starts, though a later one still will be.

Because that check is silent when there is nothing to report, the main menu
also has a **Check for updates** button, between Settings and Quit. It answers
either way: it either offers the new version or tells you the one you are on.
It offers a version you skipped as well, since you asked — which is how to
change your mind.

Say yes and it downloads, then offers to restart. It has to close to put the
new files in place and starts itself again afterwards. **Your progress is never
at risk**: saves, settings and key bindings live in `%APPDATA%\AudioDefence`
(`~/Library/Application Support/AudioDefence` on the Mac), and an update only
ever replaces the game's own program files.

**On Android** the check, the button and the three answers are the same, and so
is the download, said as it goes. An app cannot be changed a file at a time, so
the whole app comes down, and in place of the restart the game hands it to
Android, which asks on a screen of its own whether to update the app. The first
time, Android also has to be told that the game may install apps: the game
says so and opens that setting, **Allow from this source**, and carries on when
you come back with it on. Neither of those screens is the game's, so it cannot
read them out — turn TalkBack on for them if you need it. Android closes the
game while it installs; start it again afterwards. Your progress is kept, since
an update never touches the app's saves — only uninstalling the app does (see
[Your progress on the phone](#your-progress-on-the-phone)). If you
say no on Android's screen, or answer **Not yet**, the download is kept and the
next start offers to install it.

**An update downloads only what changed.** The release is around 155 MB, and
nearly all of it is the game's audio, which is the same in every build. The
updater reads the archive's index over the network and compares it with what
you already have, file by file, so a build that only fixes code is a download
of a few megabytes rather than the whole game again.

**A file that goes missing is put back.** The game knows which files it was
released with. If one of them is no longer there — a language file deleted, a
sound taken out — it asks when it starts whether to download it again, and
puts it back from the release of the version you already have. Nothing that is
there is touched, and there is no restart unless the file is one the game only
reads as it starts, in which case it says so. **No** means not now, as it does
for an update: the next time the game starts, it asks again. **Check for
updates** offers them too when there is no newer version, and when there is
one, installing it puts them back as well. A file you have changed is not
missing, and
is left as it is until the next update puts the game's own files back as they
were released (see [The language files](#the-language-files)).

If you would rather it did not look, **Settings → Miscellaneous → Check for
updates when the game starts** switches it off, and the question about missing
files with it. The main menu's Check for
updates button asks whenever you like, and its hint is the version you are on.
Run from source, that button is a line saying updating is not available — a
checkout is updated with git, not from a release. Answering "Not yet" to a
restart keeps the download:
the next time you start the game it offers to finish the job rather than
fetching anything a second time.

Turning is the one place a phone cannot be copied. The original turns with the
gyroscope, a finger drag or a tilt; here all three are the turn keys held down,
and the only difference left is how fast they turn:

| Settings → Aiming | turn speed at the default sensitivity |
|---|---|
| Gyro | the slowest, about 110 degrees a second |
| Swipe | in between, about 160 |
| Tilt | the fastest, about 190 |

**Turn sensitivity** — 0.5 to 3, Enter for the next value, Shift+Enter for the
previous — scales all three in proportion, so it is the dial to reach for
first; the three rows only choose where it starts from. All three are kept
because the tutorial has a separate announcer clip for each.

## How faithful this is

Faithful here means the game itself. What you play is the original's, and it
stays that way: the waves, the zombies, the weapons and what they cost, the
challenges, the sounds, and the quirks that shape how it plays. The port also
adds things, and will go on adding them — some around the game, like the updater
or Copy results, and in time some inside it, like new tarot cards or another
arena. Whatever is added follows the original's concept and sits beside what the
original has, rather than changing it. You can hear the line in Settings: the
original's own rows work as they always did, and only the rows the port added
step through their values with Enter and Shift+Enter. The additions are listed
together under *New in the port*, apart from the changes to what the original
already had.

The port is written method by method against the original's arm64 disassembly, and the rule it follows is to
copy what the game does rather than what it ought to do — its bugs included. Every place it departs from
that is written down in `docs/PORTING_NOTES.md`, with the address of the method it came from, so any of them
can be checked against the binary or put back. Listed below are the ones you would notice while playing; the
rest are internal — analytics that only log locally, a sanity check that only printed, an undefined return
value nothing reads.

There are **184 divergences** and **15 original quirks kept on purpose** in the notes, of which 81 are
listed here.

### 1. Windows standing in for a phone

The original is played by touch and device motion. None of that exists here, so the input layer is the
port's own work and has no counterpart in the binary.

- Every gameplay action is a key, and every key is rebindable in **Settings → Keyboard**. An action can hold
  several keys: Enter adds one, Shift+Enter replaces them all, Delete removes the one added last, and an
  action is never left with none.
- Turning replaces the gyroscope, the finger drag and the handset tilt. All three schemes remain, because
  the tutorial has a separate announcer clip for each, but on a keyboard they differ only in speed — about
  110, 160 and 190 degrees a second at the default sensitivity, all scaling in proportion to it.
- The menus are driven by a VoiceOver stand-in: elements are read in the nibs' frame order with their
  labels and traits, and their hints on their own after a pause, as VoiceOver reads them. Which arrow pair moves the cursor is a setting; the other pair changes tab.
  Holding a movement key repeats it.
- Settings gained categories, a turn sensitivity (a sighted-only slider in the original) and the key
  bindings. The main menu gained a Quit button, which no iOS app needs.
- Key names are spoken the way people say them, so the two Enter keys read as "Enter" and "Numpad Enter".
- Saves are split into `save.json`, `settings.json` and `keys.json` instead of one plist.

### 2. Where the original's screen-reader path was wrong

These are the largest group. The original ships a VoiceOver path that in places says the wrong thing, says
nothing, or says something no keyboard player can act on.

- **Escape on the completed screen goes back to the challenge list** (the original goes to the main menu,
  which on a phone is a scrub out of the whole flow). The list is where the next challenge is, and the main
  menu is one Escape further. The screen's Select challenge button is unchanged, and the screen you get
  after failing a challenge still goes to the main menu.
- **A row that does something makes a sound.** The original's buttons click but its table rows do not,
  which sighted is invisible and on a keyboard is not: opening a challenge, opening a zombie's page, or
  pressing Preview sound answered with silence, and silence is what a key that missed sounds like. Those
  three now click. A challenge row you cannot open yet stays silent, because nothing happens.
- **Screens name themselves.** Every screen sets a page title that the iPhone layout has nowhere to show, so
  on iOS it is never seen or heard. Four are named for the button that opens them rather than the original's
  own word, so the two agree — the main menu, the stats portal reached by Info, the two Info pages, and the
  tarot screen, which is called Endless because that is how Endless starts. The challenge screens all set
  "CHALLENGE", which made four different screens announce the same word; each is now named for the row that
  opened it.
- **The results screens read one line per result** — "Coins Earned: 7802", "Score: 11882144" — the same
  lines Copy results pastes, with Copy results straight after them, before the other buttons. After an
  Endless game the first line is the tarot cards you played with, which the original never tells you;
  after a challenge it is the challenge's name, then whether you completed or failed it. The original reads
  "Rewards", "Statistics" and "Stars" headings, and its rewards as sentences: "Coins, You earned 7802 coins
  for killing zombies". The Endless screen's Play again button is called **Close**: it still takes you
  back to the Endless screen, where you can play again.
- **The cursor opens on a screen's own first item**, not on the Back button and the coin and diamond
  readouts that precede it. They are still one step back.
- **The tarot deal is silent on iOS** — the flip sound plays at the end of an animation that is skipped for
  VoiceOver. Here you hear the cards.
- **A card you pay to change is never saved on iOS**: leave the screen and the old card is back, diamonds
  gone. Here it is saved.
- **The coins and diamonds counters only update their spoken label on certain screens**, so a purchase could
  leave you hearing the old balance. Here the spoken number follows the one on screen.
- **The statistics screen speaks a weapon's exact accuracy.** iOS cuts it at the decimal point and reads a
  weapon you have never fired as "accuracy, nan percent".
- **The loadout tab names the currency** a locked weapon is sold in, instead of announcing a diamonds-only
  weapon as "costs : 0 coins".
- **The armory's Back button takes one step**, closing the weapon page and leaving you on the row you opened,
  instead of closing the page and the armory together.
- **Opening a weapon from the Loadout tab clicks**, the way opening one in the Weapons tab, or a power-up,
  already did. The loadout was the one way into a weapon page the original left silent.
- **Closing a weapon page and equipping a weapon click too.** Those three buttons are plain ones in the
  original, and only its font buttons make a sound.
- **Every sound of the game waits while it is paused**, and carries on from where it was. The Minigun kept
  firing through the pause menu, because the original's pause holds only the zombies and the arena, and
  says nothing about a power-up in hand. The arena's own ambience keeps sounding.
- **Being killed by a Berserk counts.** The enemy kills you from a state the original never reports a death
  from, so its own "killed you" tally stayed at zero however often it got you, and the Deaths total on the
  statistics screen missed those deaths as well.
- **The coins and the diamonds are shown in the menus under Play and nowhere else**, whichever mode you are
  in and whatever is added later. In the original each screen decides, with no pattern to it: Settings shows
  them, the challenge list does, the screen after a challenge does not.
- **A power-up's page reads like a weapon's**: the coins and diamonds can be read while you are deciding
  what to spend them on, its back button says what it closes, and the title says which level you are on.
  The original's page hides the whole screen behind it, bare name and price only.
- Zombiepedia's preview button, its Next and Previous buttons, and the armory's upgrade button were
  unlabelled, double-labelled or silent about their price. Four strings written in capitals are spoken in
  sentence case; the screen keeps the capitals.

### 3. Original bugs fixed

Faults in the game's own logic, not in how it describes itself. Each was read against the disassembly first.

- **A finished game's rewards are paid once.** `ignoreRewards` is asked and the answer thrown away, so the
  challenge overview — which sets it precisely to avoid paying — credited the last game's coins and diamonds
  again, every time it was opened.
- **A power-up no longer survives the game it was picked up in.** The clean-up is sent to the gameplay
  weapon manager, whose power-up is always nil; the shared manager that actually owns it was never cleaned.
- **A "survive" mission advances.** The mission manager's tick asks one unrelated question and never
  forwards itself, so survival time stayed at zero however long you lived.
- **A "kill N zombies" mission remembers its count** across restarts; the field was missing from the save.
- **A dead player can no longer fire, reload, melee or switch weapons.** On iOS the death overlay swallows
  the touches; keys do not route through the view hierarchy here, so it had to be honoured explicitly.
- **The first control-scheme screen offers Gyro.** The nib wires its label outlet to the Gyro button itself,
  so under a screen reader the recommended scheme — the one a fresh profile starts on — was hidden.
- **Cows and cars move at their own speed.** Each was added to the passer-by list twice and updated twice.
- **The tornado cleans up once** instead of on every tick for the rest of the game.
- **An explosion pauses a jukebox.** The handler that does it overrides a selector nobody sends.
- **The post-game statistics show the combo they measured**, not the kill count a second time.
- **The completed screen reports a failed accuracy objective as failed.**
- **A weapon at its maximum level says nothing** instead of "Not enough Diamonds!".
- **The armory's Currency tab says it is empty**, rather than being a tab you land in with nothing in it.
- **The enemy unlock gate reads the enemy's name**, not the brick's slot label, so an enemy in a repeat slot
  could not walk through it.

### 4. Sound and music

- **Menu music plays on every menu.** The original starts it on three screens only, so any menu you reach
  out of a game is silent. The pause, revive, challenge-failed and statistics screens keep their own sound.
- **Returning to the menus does not replay the opening sting.** Coming back from a finished challenge used
  to restart the 13-second intro before the theme returned.
- **The menu theme and the game-over theme are the same file.** Both are 2,121,278 bytes with the same
  checksum: one 129-second piece of music shipped under two names. The original treats them as two tracks,
  so "changing" from one to the other faded the music out and started the very same music again from the
  beginning — which you heard on arriving at a completed challenge, and again on leaving it for the
  challenge list. Asking for either name while either one is playing now leaves it alone, so the music
  runs unbroken from a challenge's closing line through the menus.
- **Menu music asked for while the previous track is still fading is no longer lost**, and a second fault in
  the same area could wedge the audio playlist so nothing ever started it again for the rest of the session.
- **A wave that is only a cutscene plays it.** Its sounds are built asynchronously, so for an instant the
  wave looks empty — and a wave with no enemies looked finished the moment it loaded, ending the challenge
  before its closing line existed.
- **A challenge's next wave waits for its cows** (user request). A cow still to come or still walking when
  a wave's last zombie died used to wander on through the next wave, for up to a minute. Now the next
  wave, and the end of the challenge, wait until the cows have walked off or been shot, and the challenge's
  clock stops meanwhile, so a time star is no harder. Car alarms, the jukebox and the machine stay from wave
  to wave as before, since they never leave by themselves, and a power-up crate never holds a wave up.
- **Dying in a challenge starts no music.** This is the one item on this list taken from a recording rather
  than the disassembly: the binary has a line that would start the game-over theme, the real game plays none,
  and the mechanism that suppresses it could not be found.
- **A wave's ambience plays.** `Horde_ambiant` is written into 17 waves and the port had been muting it
  through a misread of the disassembly; a zombie with its own ambience still takes over while it lives.
- **The Chainsaw ambience stops when a game ends**, instead of playing on until the app closes.
- **Two zombies of the same kind no longer silence each other.** They shared their sounds, one per file, so
  when both picked the same one, the first to be shot or to change step stopped it under the other, which
  walked on without a sound. The same sharing made a second death silent after a revive, when it was a
  zombie of the same kind again — always, for the Shield zombie. Each zombie now has sounds of its own.
- **A critical kill is never silent.** The Shield, WeakZombieD, ZombieC and the passers-by have no death
  sound of their own for a critical hit, and the original played nothing instead — after stopping the hit
  sound that was playing. Melee weapons are often critical, so a Shield killed with one tended to fall
  silent. They now die with their ordinary death sound.
- **Two zombies dying together are both heard to the end.** The first to fall silent could unload the
  other's sounds and cut its death off half way; a zombie's sounds now wait until it is quiet.
- 3D positioning is correct from the first frame; the original relies on the gyroscope firing to correct it.
- **The sound follows your output.** Choose other headphones or speakers while the game is running and its
  sound moves to them, 3D and all, the way the speech already did; it used to stay on whatever was the
  default when the game started.

### 5. Engine and presentation

- The original's reverb (two Freeverbs, six combs and three allpasses each) runs in the port itself, on a
  second OpenAL Soft device mixed into the output — about half a millisecond behind the dry path.
- Screens are not animated: a view controller appears at once, and animation completions run after the
  animation's duration.
- The reading order is approximated from the nib frames, and no screen wraps at its ends.
- Game Center, the Twitter and Facebook sharing buttons, and the "more games" screen are removed.
- The per-sound hard clip of the binaural panner is not reproduced.

### 6. New in the port

Things the original never had. Each one sits beside the original's own screens and rows rather than
replacing them.

- **Check for updates**, on the main menu, and a quiet check each time the game starts, which you can
  switch off in **Settings → Miscellaneous**. An update downloads only the files that changed. See
  [Updates](#updates).
- **Copy results**, on the screen at the end of a run, puts the results on the clipboard. See
  [Sharing a result](#sharing-a-result).
- **Restart challenge**, on the pause menu during a challenge, so a challenge you have already lost does not
  have to be played to the end.
- **The tutorial announcer's lines are also spoken as text**, naming the keys you have actually bound — or,
  if you choose, a connected controller's buttons ("use the R2 button to fire"), and under Gesture the melee
  line offers the shake too, on a controller that can be shaken. The
  announcer tells you to tilt the device, swipe, or tap a corner button, none of which a keyboard can do.
  **Settings → Miscellaneous → Tutorial text** chooses when, or turns it off: Enter steps to the next
  setting, Shift+Enter to the previous.
- **Settings → Speech**: Speech output — Automatic, or one screen reader or voice only — SAPI 5's
  voice, rate, rate boost, pitch and volume, whether hints are read and how long after their item, and a
  calibration that measures how fast the speech reads, which the game asks for when it starts until it has
  been done. A second speech, with its own output, voice and calibration, can read what is said during a
  game. See [Accessibility](#accessibility) and [A second speech](#a-second-speech).
- **Settings → Miscellaneous → Remember cursor position** (off by default) returns the cursor to the row
  you left a screen on.
- **A menu music volume**: Page Up and Page Down, on any menu, in steps of 10% from 100% — the original's
  own level, never louder — down to silent. It is kept with your settings. Only the menu music: in a game,
  and on the pause screen, the keys do nothing and the game's music and ambience are untouched.
- **Settings → Miscellaneous → Reset all settings** puts every setting back to its default, except your key
  bindings.
- **Settings → Sound → 3D sound** chooses which head the game hears with: the game's own, OpenAL Soft's
  built-in on a computer, or an `.mhr` file of your own; **Test 3D sound** plays a sound once around you. See
  [3D sound](#3d-sound).
- **Settings → Miscellaneous → Clear all saves** starts the game again from nothing and keeps your settings
  and buttons; **Open game data folder** opens the folder the game keeps its files in, and on the phone
  **Export backup** and **Import backup** keep a copy of them in Documents and bring it back.
- **Play → Extra**, forty-eight arenas written for this port rather than ported, in six chapters of eight,
  gathered in a list of campaigns of which they are the first.
  An arena opens when the one before it is beaten, and a chapter on the stars won in the chapters before
  it. Each is read out first on the game's own challenge screen — objective, tip and stars — as the
  selector does for the original's, and none of them says how it is beaten. Between them they use every
  weapon in the armory, every power-up a crate can hold and every kind of zombie; from chapter 4 on some
  want guns upgraded with diamonds, so a player may have to play Endless before going on. They tell a
  story, *The Long Way Home*, in text, and end with **Reprise**, every chapter again in one long arena with
  the weapons changing hands between acts. A part of the story is read out as a wave begins, the way the
  original's challenges play Dr. Bastard's lines: the game goes on, so you can turn, switch, reload and
  fire, and the wave comes once it has been read, or at once if you skip the narration. A death offers a
  revive for diamonds, which plays the wave again from its start, its story and the clock included, or a
  skip to the next wave for ten times as much, which gives up that run's time star.
- **Game controllers**: a DualSense, DualShock, Xbox, Switch Pro or most other pads, in the menus and in
  play, with a stick that turns as fast as it is pushed, vibration for the heartbeat, hits, kills,
  explosions and your death, the phone's shake, and a DualSense's triggers that feel like a gun, each at
  the strength you choose. Each kind of controller keeps its own buttons, and the hints and the tutorial
  can name its buttons instead of the keys. See
  [With a game controller](#with-a-game-controller).
- **A third tarot card** before an Endless game, from a deck of twelve the original ships and never deals,
  **and a fourth about a quarter of the time**, from a deck of the port's own where every card helps and
  hurts at once. Neither can be changed at any price, so a hand always holds cards nobody picked. The
  first two are as they were, at 3 diamonds and 2, and the deal still takes the time it always took. A
  **Shuffle** button deals the locked cards again together, for 3 diamonds and 2,500 coins — a new set,
  not a choice, so it may be worse than what you had.
- **New tarot cards**, good and bad, dealt from the original's own decks alongside its cards. Each deck
  keeps its subject — the arena, the zombies, your guns — and gains as many good cards as bad, so the
  third card stays an even chance. More will follow.
- **A fifth level for four of the power-ups** — the Minigun, the Fireworks, the Tesla and the Tornado.
  It is not for sale: the Powered Power Ups tarot card is the only way to reach it, and before this that
  card gave a player who had bought every upgrade nothing at all.

### Original quirks kept on purpose

Fifteen remain. Each is a design decision rather than a fault, a change that would alter how the game plays
or sounds rather than what it tells you, or something with no observable effect at all.

The ones you can notice:

- **Melee cancels a reload.** Swinging mid-reload interrupts it and swings anyway, where firing mid-reload
  waits. Kept: swinging the machete while reloading is something the game lets you do, and losing the reload
  is what it costs.
- **Endless makes you earn an enemy; challenges hand it to you.** Five enemies carry a kill requirement —
  the Whisperer 150, the Berserk 250, the Riot Gear Zombie 350, the Zombie Dog 400, the Colossus 450 —
  counted against your total kills, of anything, across the whole save. Endless checks it and throws away
  any wave containing an enemy you have not earned yet, so you meet them roughly in the order intended.
  Challenge scripts never check, which is how a challenge called "Meet the Berserk!" can introduce one to a
  new player. Once your total passes the number, Endless spawns them too — the gate is temporary, and it is
  not a difference in what the two modes can contain.
- **An explosion cannot hurt a Berserk that has not been woken.** The blast solver and the explosive
  weapon's targeting both consult the same "can be shot at" test, which excludes an enemy in its sleeping
  state.
- **The difficulty mix stops changing at wave 11**, after which difficulty ramps by a fixed step instead.
  The wave table has a twelfth row nothing can reach.
- **Weapon timers advance by wall-clock time**, not by their timer's interval. Changing it would alter every
  fire rate and reload.
- **Only looping voice and footstep sounds reach the reverb**; hits, pain, death, impacts and explosions are
  dry. Changing it would rewrite how the game sounds.
- **Explosion damage falls off by squared distance whatever the blast radius** — the radius cancels itself
  out of the formula. Changing it would re-balance every explosive weapon.
- **The statistics screen after a death is silent**, because a skipped `viewDidLoad` never starts its theme.
  Kept deliberately: it is the score you just lost, not a menu.

The other seven have no observable effect: a message to a nil receiver, a return value every caller
discards, a hardcoded sound speed no data can reach, a navigation call the port never makes, a dispatch
whose timing works out the same either way, a button left in the state its branch wanted, and a dictionary
keyed by display name.

## What has been taken out

A few things the original shipped are gone rather than ported. Each is either something that cannot work
outside an iPhone in 2015, or a dead end that would only cost you a keypress to discover.

**Three keys: the magic tap on F2, the repeat key on F1, and Space.** VoiceOver has a two-finger double
tap that a screen can answer with its most obvious action, and the port had put it on F2. Every screen that
answered it did so by pressing a button the cursor already reaches — Play, Play again, Next mission — so it
was a second way to do something the menu does anyway, and on the revive screen after a death it was a
second way to end the run without meaning to. `docs/PORTING_NOTES.md` records what each screen's did. F1
read the focused element out again, which your screen reader's own review keys already do. Space activated
whatever the cursor was on, beside Enter; it is now the fire key in a game and nothing else. Enter, and the
number pad's Enter, activate.

**The armory's Currency tab.** It was built to hold four "free coins" offers — follow the game on Facebook,
follow it on Twitter, look at the studio's other games, rate it on the App Store — each of which opened a
web page. None of them was ever wired up: the tab's table asks a `products` array for its row count and
nothing in the binary ever fills that array in, so the tab was blank on every device that ever ran the game.
For a while this port kept it and had it explain itself, with a line that read:

> This tab is empty. It offered free coins for following the game on social media. Those links are long
> dead, and the original never filled this tab in either.

which is a fair description of a tab you should not have to visit. It is now removed, leaving Weapons,
Loadout and Powerup. Two knock-on changes came with it: the "Not enough Coins!" alert no longer offers its
"More coins" button, which opened that tab, and the last sentence of that alert — "You can also get coins in
the Armory's currency tab" — is not shown, since it would be pointing at nothing. The two ways of earning
coins that do work are still named.

**Sharing and Game Center.** The Twitter and Facebook buttons on the game-over screen, and the score
reporting to Game Center, are removed. There is no Game Center on Windows, and the sharing buttons opened
apps that are not here.

**The "more games" screen.** A catalogue of the studio's other iOS titles, reachable from the stats portal.
It advertised apps you cannot install from a machine that cannot run them.

**Unreachable screens are simply not ported**, which is a different thing from removal — the game still
contains them, nothing can open them, and the port does not implement them: the scenario roulette and the
story screen (nothing calls them, no NIB action reaches them), the cheat screen (its button is hidden), the
enemy-unlock popup and the score-feedback view (never allocated). `docs/PORTING_NOTES.md` lists them with
the reasoning.

**Touch handlers are ported but never called**, which is also not removal. A few of the original's methods
are here in full with nothing to reach them, because a keyboard sends no fingers: `touchesMoved:`
0x10008a5a4, the weapon buttons' touch-down and touch-up 0x1000a9d78 and 0x1000a9d7c, the shake
`motionEnded:` 0x10005a108. `hitByProjectile:` 0x100061098 is here for a different reason: nothing in the
original calls it either, because a rocket's damage is dealt by `solveExplosionOfProjectile` 0x1000c6360
instead. They stay as the record of what the original did, next to the keyboard code that stands in for
them. That is the line the magic tap fell the wrong side of: it was not a handler waiting for input the
port never sends, it was a gesture the port had invented a key for, so when the key went there was nothing
left to keep — and `post_announcement`, which existed only to say "no magic tap available on this screen",
went with it.

                        makemhr/, OpenAL Soft's tool for making an HRTF

### `game/` — the original

The contents of the IPA's app bundle, unwrapped. The port reads them in place:
the plists, the `en.lproj` strings, the S3D playlist models under `game/meta/`
and the 918 sound files under `game/sounds/`, in the layout the bundle already
has. Nothing is copied and nothing is converted, so a clone has everything the
game needs.

The port reads it from `game/`, unless `--game PATH` (or the
`AUDIODEFENCE_GAME` environment variable) points somewhere else. The first line
in the log says which one it took.

Not all of it is used: the port never draws, so the `.png` artwork, the `.ttf`
fonts and `html/` are along for the ride, and `_CodeSignature/` is Apple's
tamper manifest. They are kept so `game/` stays the complete original. Do not
be misled by the underscore in `game/sounds/_weapons/` or in the `_fight` /
`_zombie` sub-playlists — those are game data, not metadata.

### `analysis/` — the reverse engineering

46 MB of generated material, and the reason the port can claim to be faithful:

| file | what is in it |
|---|---|
| `disasm/<unit>.s` | full annotated listings of all 7,692 functions, one file per class |
| `digest/<unit>.txt` | the condensed pseudo-code view of the same functions |
| `bin/` | the `arm64` and `armv7` slices pulled out of the fat binary |
| `objc.json`, `classdump.h`, `cxx_classes.txt` | 400 Objective-C classes, 43 C++ classes with vtables |
| `xrefs.json`, `functions.tsv` | per function: calls, callers, selectors, strings, ivars, float constants |
| `data/nibs/*.txt` | 150 NIB dumps: view trees, frames, texts, VoiceOver labels, outlets, actions |
| `data/plists/*.json`, `playlists.json`, `sounds.tsv` | the game's data as JSON, the 208 playlists, the sound inventory |
| `data/embedded_hrtf.dat` | the HRTF table extracted from the binary |

The game never reads any of it. It is all rebuildable from `game/`, and it is
what every address comment in the port points into.

## Command line options

None of them is needed to play; they exist so a session can be started at a
particular point, and so automated runs can finish on their own.

**Most of them only exist when the game is run from a checkout.** A release
knows `--game` and `--log-level` and nothing else, and answers *unrecognized
arguments* to the rest — they are never added to it. Those are the ones that
start the game past its own rules, and a built copy should not carry a switch
that turns those rules off. The two that stay are the two a player might
genuinely need: pointing the game at its data, and turning up the log when
something misbehaves.

| option | what it does |
|---|---|
| `--endless` *(checkout only)* | start an endless game directly. This skips the play menu (so it works before Endless is unlocked by finishing `tutorial_5`) and skips the tarot cards, so no card modifiers are in play. |
| `--challenge NAME` *(checkout only)* | start one challenge by its plist name (`tutorial_1`, `arena1_3`, …). It skips the selector, so the challenge's weapon and completion requirements are not checked — your saved inventory is still what you play with. |
| `--game PATH` | read the game's data from somewhere other than `game/` (see below). |
| `--log-level debug` | log every decision the engine makes, not just the milestones. The first thing to try when something misbehaves. |
| `--free-cards` *(checkout only)* | every card in the hand can be changed, whatever the slot and locked or not, and none of them costs anything. For trying a particular card out: press Enter on it until it comes up, instead of playing hands until it does. |
| `--mute` *(checkout only)* | set the listener's gain to zero: the game runs in silence. |
| `--no-speech` *(checkout only)* | never speak, so a test run does not talk over your screen reader. |
| `--exit-after SECONDS` *(checkout only)* | quit cleanly after this long, for unattended runs. |

A game started with `--endless` or `--challenge` saves its score, kills and
stats like any other, so it can legitimately unlock things.

### `--game`

The port does not hard-code where the original's files are: it reads `game/`
unless `--game PATH` (or the `AUDIODEFENCE_GAME` environment variable) names
another folder holding the data — one with `meta/` and `sounds/` inside it.
With the game in the repository you never need the option; it is there for the
cases where the data is somewhere else:

    py AudioDefence.py --game "D:/backups/audiodefence.app"

* a clone without `game/` (if it is ever ignored by git), with your own copy
  kept elsewhere;
* running against a second copy — another version of the bundle, or one you
  have edited — without touching `game/`;
* a packaged build whose data sits beside the executable.

It accepts the app bundle itself or a folder holding it (`audiodefence.app` or
`Payload/audiodefence.app` inside). The first line of the log says which path
won, so it is easy to tell whether the option took effect:

    main INFO game data: D:/backups/audiodefence.app (from the AUDIODEFENCE_GAME environment variable)

## Working on the port

The rule the port is written by: **never from memory**. Before changing a
ported method, read the original again — the address is in the comment above
it — and compare side by side.

    py tools/query.py digest "ADEnemy update:"        pseudo-code for a method
    py tools/query.py digest "ADWeapon " 90           a whole class, skipping tiny accessors
    py tools/query.py fn "ADPlayer update:"           the full annotated listing
    py tools/query.py sel setHeadOrientation:         who sends a selector
    py tools/query.py callers "ADBrickManager loadNextBrick"
    py tools/query.py str "brick_chance"              who references a string
    py tools/query.py ivar "ADEnemy._life"            who reads / writes an ivar
    py tools/query.py const 0.8                       who loads a float constant
    py tools/listing.py "ADWeapon fire" 0x100 0x200   a range of one listing
    py tools/nib_layout.py --all ADMainMenuViewController   a screen's frames and labels
    py tools/verify_stats.py                          every weapon and enemy vs the plists
    py tools/verify_updater.py                        the updater, end to end, offline
    py tools/verify_localization.py                   every phrase a player reads, in each language
    py tools/make_language.py                         every language file up to date, and template.json
    py tools/merge_language.py FILE LANGUAGE          a language file someone sent, into the game's own

The digests are condensed and sometimes drop code that matters — when a branch
does not add up, read the `.s` listing for the same function. Annotation
conventions: `[receiver selector:args]` message sends, `self->ivar` field
access, `tN = …` temporaries, `if (cond) goto loc_…` branches, `switch (…)`
decoded jump tables, `one of {…}` where a value depends on the path taken.
Integer division by constants appears in compiled form — §2 of
`docs/GAME_STRUCTURE.md` has the patterns.

Screens are built from the NIB dumps in `analysis/data/nibs/`: the port uses
the iPhone tag-2781 layout, and the `Accessible_*` NIB wherever the original
has one, because the game swaps those in when VoiceOver is running.

When something has to differ from the original it goes in the Divergences
section of `docs/PORTING_NOTES.md`; when a bug of the original's is kept on
purpose it goes in the quirks section. Both say why.

Everything in the repository is stored with LF endings (`.gitattributes` says
so, and `game/`, `vendor/` and `analysis/bin/` are marked binary so not a byte
of them is touched). The tools write LF too, whatever machine they run on, so
regenerating `analysis/` produces no line-ending churn to commit.

## Rebuilding and recovering

Everything except `audiodefence/`, `tools/`, `docs/` and `game/` can be
regenerated. Run these from the project root.

**The whole analysis** — needs `capstone` (and `av` for the sound durations):

    py tools/macho.py extract game/audiodefence analysis/bin
    py tools/objc.py analysis/bin/audiodefence_arm64
    py tools/disasm.py analysis/bin/audiodefence_arm64 --out analysis
    py tools/query.py make-digests
    py tools/resources.py game --out analysis/data
    py tools/extract_hrtf.py analysis/bin/audiodefence_arm64

**The HRTF**, if `assets/hrtf/audiodefence_ircam1050.mhr` is deleted:

    py tools/build_hrtf.py

It rebuilds the file from `analysis/data/embedded_hrtf.dat` and prints the
interaural level difference and delays at five angles as a sanity check — a
sound on the right should be louder and earlier in the right ear. Add
`--verify` to replay the original's panner maths for every angle and compare
the two (non-zero exit code if they disagree); the file written is the same
either way. If `analysis/data/embedded_hrtf.dat` is gone as well, extract it
first — and note that the extractor needs the thin arm64 slice, not the fat
`game/audiodefence`:

    py tools/macho.py extract game/audiodefence analysis/bin
    py tools/extract_hrtf.py analysis/bin/audiodefence_arm64      needs capstone
    py tools/build_hrtf.py

`build_hrtf.py` writes the `.mhr` file itself, in Python with `numpy`: no
other program and no C++ compiler is needed for the game's own HRTF.

### OpenAL Soft and the HRTF

The game's 3D sound is played by [OpenAL Soft](https://openal-soft.org/), an
open-source sound library. Its copy comes with the repository, so there is
nothing to install:

- Windows: `vendor\openal\soft_oal.dll`, version 1.25.1.
- Mac: `vendor/openal-mac/libopenal.dylib`, built by
  `tools/build_openal_mac.sh`.
- The phone does not use it: the Android app has a small mixer of its own
  that reads the same HRTF file.

**How the game sets it up.** Every time it starts, the game writes OpenAL
Soft's settings file, `alsoft.ini`, to the system's temporary folder
(`%TEMP%\AudioDefence\alsoft.ini` on Windows), and points OpenAL Soft at it
with the `ALSOFT_CONF` environment variable, so OpenAL Soft reads the game's
settings and nobody else's. The file turns HRTF on, says where the game's HRTF
files are (`hrtf-paths`: the `assets\hrtf` folder, then the player's own
`hrtf` folder next to the game, then OpenAL Soft's own places, which is what
brings in its built-in HRTF) and which one to start with (`default-hrtf`,
`audiodefence_ircam1050`). The game then switches to the one chosen in
Settings → Sound → 3D sound. Editing the file does nothing: it is written
again at the next start. Your own OpenAL settings for other programs,
`%APPDATA%\alsoft.ini`, are never read or changed.

**What is in OpenAL Soft's Windows zip.** The binaries,
`openal-soft-<version>-bin.zip`, come from
[OpenAL Soft's website](https://openal-soft.org/) or its
[releases on GitHub](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/releases). Unzipped,
the folders this game cares about are:

- `bin\Win64\soft_oal.dll`: the library itself, 64-bit. `bin\Win32` holds the
  32-bit one, which the game does not use.
- `makemhr\makemhr.exe`, with `zlib1.dll` beside it: the tool that makes an
  HRTF file. Keep the two together. The repository carries a copy, in
  `vendor\makemhr`.
- `hrtf_defs`: example definition files for well-known research sets
  (`MIT_KEMAR.def`, `MIT_KEMAR_sofa.def`, `IRC_1005.def`, `SCUT_KEMAR.def`,
  `CIAIR.def`). Each says at the top where its recordings can be downloaded,
  and under what terms.
- `openal-info64.exe`: lists the sound devices and the HRTFs OpenAL Soft can
  find.
- The rest (`include`, `libs`, `cxx-modules`, `presets`, `alsoft-config`)
  is for programmers and for other programs' settings; the game needs none of
  it.

**Updating OpenAL Soft on Windows,** in three steps:

- **Step 1:** download and unzip the binaries, as above.
- **Step 2:** copy `bin\Win64\soft_oal.dll` over `vendor\openal\soft_oal.dll`.
- **Step 3:** start the game, then look in its log, `audiodefence.log` in
  `%APPDATA%\AudioDefence`. A line saying `game HRTF audiodefence_ircam1050
  not in use` means the new version did not take the game's HRTF; no such line
  means it did.

**Making another HRTF.** `makemhr` turns a recording of how a head hears sound
from every direction into an `.mhr` file, with no C++ or anything else to
install. Research sets of these usually come as SOFA files (`.sofa`), which
`makemhr` reads directly; it also reads its own `.def` definition files, like
the ones in `hrtf_defs`.

**Step 1:** download the research set's recordings: each `.def` in
`hrtf_defs` says where.

**Step 2:** in a Command Prompt, in the folder with the recordings, run
`makemhr.exe` at the game's sample rate, 44100. For a SOFA file, with the
repository's copy:

    "C:\path\to\AudioDefence\vendor\makemhr\makemhr.exe" -r 44100 -i set.sofa -o set.mhr

Or with one of the definition files:

    "C:\path\to\AudioDefence\vendor\makemhr\makemhr.exe" -r 44100 -i MIT_KEMAR.def -o MIT_KEMAR.mhr

**Step 3:** put the `.mhr` in the `hrtf` folder next to the game, not in
`assets\hrtf`, and choose it in Settings → Sound → 3D sound. See
[Your own 3D sound](#your-own-3d-sound), which goes through all of this for
players.

**Step 4:** check the research set's licence before giving the file to anyone:
some may not be passed on with a game, which is why none is built into it.

**Updating makemhr.** Copy the zip's `makemhr` folder, both files, over
`vendor\makemhr`, and change the version in `vendor\makemhr\README.txt`: it
names the OpenAL Soft release the files came from, and links to that release's
source, which the GPL asks to be findable.

## Building an executable

    py -m pip install pyinstaller

Then **double-click `compiler.py`** in Explorer, or type `py compiler.py` on
its own. It asks which build you want:

    1. Release build: file the changelog under the version, build, zip, then build the Android app
    2. Android build: the Android app alone, leaving the changelog as it is
    3. Build without the zip
    4. One-file build, zipped, as a release: the changelog filed, then the Android app too
    5. One-file build without the zip
    6. Build without the game's data
    7. Show what a release build would do, without building anything
    8. Clean build: empty PyInstaller's cache first, for when a build behaves oddly
    9. Build with a console window, to see why the game will not start
    0. Quit

Type the number and press Enter. A choice that makes the Android app asks
first where your signing key is: Enter takes the one it names, or type the
path to another (see *A release*, under [On Android](#on-android)). The window waits for Enter at the end, so you
can hear how it went before it closes.

That is the whole build. The script checks what it needs, runs PyInstaller with
the right arguments, copies the game's data next to the executable and says
where the result is: `dist\AudioDefence\AudioDefence.exe`, in a folder that
runs on a machine with no Python on it at all.

The release build then builds the Android app from the same `VERSION`, with
Gradle, and leaves it at `dist\AudioDefence-Android-<version>.apk` — the APK
alone, with nothing beside it and in no zip. It needs the tools listed under
*Building the app* in [On Android](#on-android), and the app's key
(*A release*, there). If any of them is missing, the game is
still built and zipped, and the build ends by saying the APK was not made and
why. Once the setup tool's first build has run, Gradle runs with `--offline`
and downloads nothing; a part it lacks is said, and `py tools\android_setup.py`
downloads it. Choice 2, *Android build*, makes the APK alone, without touching the
changelog; with no key it makes a test build,
`dist\AudioDefence-Android-<version>-TEST.apk`, which cannot install over a
release.

Each choice is one or two of the options in the table below, and they still
work typed out — `py compiler.py --no-package` builds straight away with no
menu. Two are typed only: `--test`, and `--key`, which the menu asks for. Run with no
options and nothing to type into — from a script — it goes straight to the
release build.

PyInstaller is the only extra package, and it goes in the same Python you play
with: a build is made by following the game's own imports, so `pygame-ce`,
`numpy`, `av`, `comtypes` and `prismatoid` have to be installed there too.
`prismatoid` is optional to play from source but not to build: a release has to
carry it, or JAWS players would hear SAPI 5. The script names
anything that is missing and stops rather than building half a game. 64-bit
Python on Windows produces a 64-bit Windows executable, and only that — there
is no cross-compiling to another system.

| option | what it does |
|---|---|
| `--onefile` | one executable instead of one folder — see below before you reach for it. On its own it is a release, as the plain build is: the changelog filed, zipped, and the Android app too |
| `--no-game` | do not copy the game's data; the build then needs `--game PATH` to find it |
| `--console` | keep a console window beside the game, where a failed start-up prints its traceback |
| `--clean` | empty both of PyInstaller's working places first — this project's `build\` folder and the shared cache in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\pyinstaller` — when a rebuild behaves oddly. `dist\` is untouched, and so is everything in the repository |
| `--test` | run the result for ten seconds afterwards and read its log: that it found the game data, that the game's own HRTF is in use, and that it ended without a traceback |
| `--dry-run` | print what would happen, build nothing — including every file that would land beside the executable |
| `--no-package` | do not make the zip. A build otherwise ends by packing `dist\AudioDefence` into `dist\AudioDefence-Win-<version>.zip`, which is what a release's asset is and what the updater reads, warning first if `VERSION` is missing or `changelog.txt` still starts with `unrelease:` |
| `--android` | build the Android app alone, and leave the changelog as it is: `dist\AudioDefence-Android-<version>.apk`, signed with the key `--key` or `AD_KEYSTORE` names, or `...-TEST.apk` without one. The other options are the desktop build's and do not apply |
| `--key PATH` | sign the Android app with the key at PATH, rather than the one `AD_KEYSTORE` names or the only one in `C:\Android\Keys` |

### Cutting a release

The archive has to be a **zip**, not a rar: the updater opens it with Python's
own `zipfile` and reads single files out of it over HTTP, which is what makes a
small fix a small download, and nothing can do either with a rar without
shipping an extractor. Every build makes it, unless you choose the build without
the zip (`--no-package`).

New changes go in `changelog.txt` under one heading at the top, `unrelease:`,
one line each. You never rename that heading yourself — the build files it.
In order:

- put the version in `VERSION`, exactly as GitHub will have it: `26.09.21-1`
- double-click `compiler.py` and choose **1, Release build**
- commit and push what it tells you changed — `changelog.txt`, and `VERSION`
  if it had to make one. Every build ends by saying whether there is anything
  to commit.
- tag the release `26.09.21-1` and upload `dist\AudioDefence-Win-26.09.21-1.zip`
  and `dist\AudioDefence-Android-26.09.21-1.apk`, beside the Mac zip. The
  release build makes the APK too, signed with the key it asks you for (see
  *A release*, under [On Android](#on-android)): every release APK has to be
  signed with that same key, or phones will not install it over the one they
  have.

The release build — choice 1, or `py compiler.py` with no options from a
script, and the one-file release, choice 4 — does three things to the repository before it copies anything:

- the lines under `unrelease:` move to the entry headed exactly as `VERSION`
  says, build number and all: `26.09.21-1:`. If that entry is already there —
  you built again without changing `VERSION` — they go to the bottom of it
  instead of starting another. Change the number in `VERSION` and the next
  release build starts a new entry.
- `unrelease:` stays at the top, empty, ready for whatever changes next. If
  someone has deleted that line, it is put back.
- if there is no `VERSION` file, one is made, starting at today's first
  release: `26.09.21-1` on the 21st of September 2026.

The copy of the changelog beside the executable is the same, less the empty
`unrelease:` line, so it opens on the newest version. Every version's lines are
followed by one blank line, so where one version ends is something you hear.
Nothing under `unrelease:` means nothing is moved and the repository's
changelog is not touched. Building twice without committing is harmless: the
second build finds `unrelease:` already empty.

**Every other choice** — the clean build, the build without the zip and the
rest, and the test build typed out, or any of their options typed out — leaves the changelog
exactly as it is, because those builds are for trying something, not for
releasing it, and they end by saying there is no need to commit. If such a
build is zipped, it says so: its changelog still opens with `unrelease:`.
Choice 7, *Show what a release build would do*, reads out what the release
build would do to the changelog without writing anything.

`VERSION` is **`YY.MM.DD-XX`**: last two digits of the year, month, day, and
which release of that day it is, counting from 1. The first release on the 20th
of September 2026 is `26.09.20-1`; a second one the same day is `26.09.20-2`.
The compiler never works the number out: it follows whatever you wrote in
`VERSION`, and the changelog entry is named the same.

The build carries the number inside the executable rather than beside it: the
compiler reads `VERSION` from the repository and compiles it in. So there is no
`VERSION` file in a built game's folder, and nothing a player edits or deletes
there can change what the game thinks it is, or stop it from updating. A
`VERSION` file an older build left beside the executable is ignored. You only
ever change the number in the repository's `VERSION`. A build made with an
option while the repository has no `VERSION` file carries no number and never
offers an update, which is the one way to ship something that cannot be
updated afterwards; the release build never does this, because it starts the
file first.
Run from source, the game does the same as a release build when there is no
`VERSION` file: it makes one, at today's first release.

A build also carries three pieces of text beside the executable:
`changelog.txt`, `license.txt` (the repository's `LICENSE`, renamed so
Windows opens it without asking what with), and `readme.html` — this file,
converted at build time by
`tools/md_to_html.py`, which needs nothing installed. HTML rather than Markdown
because a screen reader moves through it by heading, table and list, where a
`.md` file reads every `#` and `|` aloud. The page is not committed, so it
cannot drift from this one; if the Markdown ever grows something the converter
does not know — a fenced code block, a numbered list — the build says so and
writes no page rather than shipping one with holes in it.
`py tools/md_to_html.py --check README.md` asks the same question at any
time.

### What a build carries, and what it does not

The port, the HRTF and the two vendored DLLs go inside the build, and on
Windows OpenAL Soft's makemhr too, with its licence, for making 3D sounds. `game/` does
not — and `game/` is the game's audio: the 918 sound files under `game/sounds/`
(the narration, the zombies, the weapons, the music), the playlists under
`game/meta/` that arrange them, the plists and the strings. Every one of those
is Somethin' Else's recording, not the port's, and a build carries them with
it.

The script copies `game/` **next to the executable** — `AudioDefence.exe` and
`game/` side by side — which is where `audiodefence/paths.py` looks when
frozen, and `--game PATH` (`AUDIODEFENCE_GAME`) still overrides it. Build with
`--no-game` and you get the port alone: no sounds, silent until it is pointed
at a copy of the original. Everything else is read out of the bundle
PyInstaller unpacks, so `assets/hrtf` and `vendor/` need no copy.

`changelog.txt` is copied next to the executable as well, so whoever plays the
build can read what changed without the repository.

### One folder, not one file

The default is a folder, and that is the right shape here. `--onefile` gives a
single executable that unpacks its whole payload — Python, pygame, numpy and
av's FFmpeg, well over 100 MB of it — into `%TEMP%` at every launch, which is
seconds of silence before the game says anything. The one-folder build starts
at once. (One file does work: the game's data is still looked for beside the
executable, not inside the payload.)

### Checking the result

    py compiler.py --test

After building it starts the game for ten seconds and reads
`%APPDATA%\AudioDefence\audiodefence.log` for the three things that matter:
that the first line says `game data: … (from the game folder next to the
executable)` and not `(missing)`; that `game HRTF audiodefence_ircam1050 not in
use` does not appear, which would mean `assets/hrtf` never made it into the
bundle and OpenAL has quietly substituted its own; and that nothing ended in a
traceback. The same run by hand is
`dist\AudioDefence\AudioDefence.exe --exit-after 10 --log-level debug`.

What no script can check for you is the sound. Start it normally and listen to
the main menu — once with NVDA, and once with NVDA closed so that SAPI is
exercised. (SAPI goes through `comtypes`, which builds its COM wrappers in
memory in a frozen program instead of writing them to disk, so it is worth
hearing rather than assuming.) If you have another screen reader, such as JAWS,
listen once with that too: it goes through Prism, whose compiled half the
build carries in `_internal\prism\_native`.

### If something is missing from the build

`av`, `comtypes` and Prism (`prism`) are all imported the first time they are
needed rather than at the top of a module (`s3d/decoder.py`,
`platform/speech.py`), so they are what PyInstaller's analysis is likeliest to
walk past. The script already names them outright — `--collect-all av`,
`--collect-submodules comtypes`, `--collect-all prism` — so the usual failures
are covered. Prism needs two more: its compiled Python module,
`prism\_native\_prism_cffi.pyd`, sits in a folder that is not a package, so
`--collect-all` leaves it behind and the script adds it by name; and
`--hidden-import _cffi_backend`, which that module needs and nothing names. For anything else that turns up as a
`ModuleNotFoundError` in a frozen run, add `--hidden-import NAME` to the list
in `command()` in `compiler.py`.

### No console window

The script passes `--windowed`, so the built game is one window and not two: a
console alongside it would be another thing in the alt-tab order announcing
itself, for nothing. What a console is good for is the moment start-up fails,
so `_report_failure` in `AudioDefence.py` does that job without one — it writes
the traceback to `%APPDATA%\AudioDefence\crash.txt` and speaks a line saying
so, and falls back to printing and waiting for Enter when there *is* a console
to print in. Build with `--console` to get one; a run from source has had one
all along.

### Afterwards

`build/` is PyInstaller's scratch folder, `dist/` is its output and
`AudioDefence.spec` is the file it writes from the arguments above; the script
regenerates all three, and none of them belongs in the repository. The reverse
engineering lives in `analysis/` precisely so that `build/` stays free.

An unsigned executable is not something Windows trusts: expect SmartScreen to
warn the first time it runs on another machine, and antivirus to hold that
first start while it scans. Signing is the only real cure.

## Troubleshooting

Everything the port does is logged to `%APPDATA%\AudioDefence\audiodefence.log`
(`--log-level debug` for more). If it fails before it can play anything, the
traceback is spoken and written to `crash.txt` in that same folder.

**Positioning feels flat, or sounds come from the wrong place.** Look for:

    s3d ERROR game HRTF audiodefence_ircam1050 not in use (found=False, status=…)

OpenAL quietly substitutes its own HRTF when the game's is missing. Rebuild it
as above; no such line means the game's own HRTF is loaded.

**"the game's data is not where the port looks for it".** `game/` is empty or
in the wrong shape: it needs `meta/` and `sounds/` at its top level. Point
`--game` at another copy if it lives elsewhere.

**Nothing is spoken.** With NVDA running the port talks to it through
`vendor/nvda/nvdaControllerClient64.dll`; with another screen reader it goes
through Prism, which needs `prismatoid`; with none it falls back to SAPI 5,
which needs `comtypes`. The log says which one it took ("speech: JAWS, through
Prism", or "Prism not available" when it could not load it).

**A screen reads in an odd order.** The reading order is reconstructed from the
NIB frames (`audiodefence/ui/accessibility.py`), so it approximates VoiceOver's
rather than copying it. Check that screen's frames with
`tools/nib_layout.py --all`.

## Credits

*Audio Defence: Zombie Arena* was made by **Somethin' Else**, and everything
worth hearing in this port is theirs. Their Papa Engine still introduces itself
as "Somethin' Else Papa Engine" every time it starts, and the source paths left
inside the binary point at Papa Sangre, which is a lovely thing to find at two
in the morning and a slightly alarming one at four.

The game's own Credits screen, under Info, lists everyone who made it and,
through some oversight in the nib, never names the studio. The port puts
**Audio Defence: Zombie Arena, by Somethin' Else** at the top of that list,
where it belongs, and adds its own credits and this repository's address after
it.

The port's cast, in roughly the order they turned up:

**Muhammad Hajjar** — *the one who started it.* Worked out that you can point
an AI at a shipped iOS binary and get a Windows game back out of it, which
sounds like a joke right up until it works. The concept is his; everything
after it is bookkeeping. He now directs the port as well, with the same Claude
at the same highest effort, so there are two people giving orders and two sets
of commits, which is how most good projects and most sitcoms begin.

**Loh Boon Keat** — *the director.* Made every judgement call about what to fix
and what to leave alone, and held the line on "compare it with the original,
don't rely on your memory" until it stuck. Play-tested a game he was building
at the same time, then asked for forty-nine new arenas designed to kill him
and, unwisely, played every one of them.

**Claude** — *the typist (Opus 5, then 5.5, at the highest effort).* Wrote
every line of the port. Read the disassembly, ported it method by method,
argued about tail calls, and was wrong twice in one evening about an ambience
loop before a human with working ears put it right. Built a robot that plays
arenas a thousand times an hour to prove they were fair, then shipped a cow
that kept mooing after the game had ended. Occasionally over-confident,
reliably apologetic.

**Wong Wee Xiang** — *quality assurance, and the reason the changelog is so
long.* Found the Tactical Rifle cutting itself off, the death screen that would
not let go, the Chainsaw ambience that outlived the game, the rewards paid
twice, and the quiet round after pressing Try again. If a bug was fixed before
you met it, there is a good chance he met it first, so that you did not have
to.

**Flameborn** — *the Mac version.* Proved that a game which left the iPhone for
Windows could find its way back to an Apple machine and still recognise the
furniture. Talked VoiceOver and the system voice into sharing the work, and is
the reason "it works on my machine" now covers two operating systems.

**Erick** — *the Android version.* Took a game that had only ever known a
keyboard and taught it to live in a pocket: wrote a sound mixer from scratch so
that the zombies still stand where they should, turned the arrow keys into
swipes and Enter into a double tap, and asked TalkBack, politely, to wait
outside while the game does the talking. Wrote all of it before the game had
ever run on a phone, which is how bridges get designed and very rarely how
games do.

**Also appearing** — the cows, who wandered into every swing and asked for
nothing in return; Dr. Bastard, as himself; and every zombie in this
repository, none of whom were harmed in the making of this port, because they
were already dead.

`game/` is the original game: Somethin' Else's data, audio and layouts. It is
not ours and it is not covered by the port's licence. `analysis/` is derived
from their binary and is in the same position. A build produced by `compiler.py`
contains all of it.

This project is not affiliated with Somethin' Else, and no claim is made to
their work.

`vendor/makemhr` is OpenAL Soft's makemhr, copied unchanged from OpenAL Soft
1.25.2: it is under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or any later
version, whose text is beside it in `COPYING.GPLv2`, and its source is
[OpenAL Soft 1.25.2's](https://github.com/kcat/openal-soft/tree/1.25.2/utils/makemhr).
Its `zlib1.dll` is zlib, under the zlib licence. The Windows build carries
both, with that text and their `README.txt`, in `_internal\vendor\makemhr`, so
that the game can make a `.sofa` into a 3D sound; they are separate programs,
not part of the game's own code.
