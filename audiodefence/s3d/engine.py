"""S3D ("Papa Engine") port: S3DEngine, S3DPlayList, S3DSound and S3DEngineDispatcher on OpenAL Soft.

The original runs the engine on two GCD serial queues and a CoreAudio render thread.  The port is
single-threaded: work the original dispatches asynchronously is queued and run by ``S3DEngine.pump``
(called by the main loop), and the dispatcher tick runs every 10 ms of wall time like
``-[S3DEngineDispatcher dispatch_pump]`` (dispatch_after 9,999,999 ns).  Rendering (HRTF, mixing,
HRTF) is OpenAL Soft's, the reverb is the original Freeverb (reverb.py); everything the S3D objects decide
is ported from the methods quoted below.

Signal path of the original (docs/GAME_STRUCTURE.md section 17) and its OpenAL mapping:

    spatialised: file(mono) -> DistanceSimulator (gain min(1/d, maxSpatialGain), air low-pass when d > 10)
                 -> BinauralPanner (IRCAM horizontal HRTF, front gain 1..1.5) -> gainControl
                 => mono buffer, source-relative position, OpenAL HRTF (assets/hrtf), AL_GAIN = product
    plain mono:  file -> csl::Panner (pan 0: 0.5 per channel) -> gainControl
                 => stereo buffer holding 0.5 * sample in both channels, AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT
    plain stereo: file -> gainControl        => stereo buffer, AL_DIRECT_CHANNELS_SOFT
    sendToReverb: gainControl -> FanOut -> dryMixer (dryGain) / wetMixer (wetGain) -> Stereoverb
                 => the source plays on the reverb bus device; its render + Stereoverb reach the output
                    through the bus's callback source (reverb.py)
    masterMixer scale = masterGain         => listener AL_GAIN
