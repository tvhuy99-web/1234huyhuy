"""PORT ADDITION: game controllers - a DualSense, a DualShock, an Xbox or Switch Pro pad, or anything SDL
knows.

The original is played by touch and by turning the phone; the port plays it from the keyboard (keymap.py),
and this is the other way in.  SDL's game controller layer names every pad's buttons the same way - the
bottom face button is ``a`` whatever is printed on it - so the bindings below hold for every controller,
and only the names spoken for them change with the kind of pad.

What a controller does:

* **In play** its buttons are bound to the same actions as the keys (``PAD_DEFAULTS``): R2 fires, R1 is
  melee, and next weapon and reload are L1 and L2 in Button mode, or a flick of a stick up or down in
  Gesture mode - the swipes the Up and Down arrows stand for on the keyboard.  Either stick turns, and
  turns as far as it is pushed: a little is slow, all the way is as fast as the turn keys; the sticks are
  the pad's own and cannot be bound.  For a player who would rather not turn with a stick, two buttons turn
  as well - the D-pad, left and right, to begin with - and those can be bound like any other: they turn at
  the keyboard's speed, since a button is either down or up.
* **In the menus** it stands in for the keys the menus already know: the D-pad or a stick for the arrows -
  which move through a screen and, on the other pair, change tab - the shoulders for moving through it as
  well, the bottom button for Enter, and held for Control (to the first or last), the right one for Escape, the
  top one for Delete, the triggers for Page Down and Page Up (the menu music volume).  ``ui/host.py`` does that
  translation; the key presses it makes are marked ``pad`` so a key being captured in Settings is not
  taken from a controller.

Triggers are read as buttons, pressed past half way and let go below a third.  A stick counts as pushed in
a direction past 60% and let go below 30%, with the direction taken from the larger of its two axes, so
turning with a stick does not flick it up or down by accident.

The phone uses this module too, since 2026-10-05 (user request): its controllers are Android's, given here
in SDL's terms by the pygame stand-in's _sdl2.controller and android_main, so everything above holds there.
What SDL itself gives the desktop - a controller's movement sensor, a DualSense's triggers and grips - the
phone has not (`sdl` is None there).  On the phone the hints name the touches that do the same, unless a
keyboard is in use or the controller's buttons have been chosen (`menu_words`).

# to change (0x04 the right trigger, 0x08 the left) and bytes 10 and 21 start the two triggers' effects.
# The effects are the pad's own simple modes, the ones SDL's test program uses: 0x05 off, 0x01 resistance
# from a point on, 0x02 resistance between two points that gives way past the second, as a gun's trigger

#: R2 is a pistol's trigger: take-up, where it moves freely and nothing happens, then the wall, where the
#: sear holds and it will not go on, and pressing through the wall breaks it and fires.  The pad's own weapon
#: effect does that - resistance from `start` to `end`, then it gives way - so the take-up runs to 55% of the
#: travel, the wall holds from there to 72%, and the break at 72% is the shot; letting the trigger back out
#: to just under the wall (GUN_UP) is the reset, and it will fire again from there.  This was the catch
#: sitting just before half the travel and breaking at half,
#: which is where the game fires (GUN_DOWN): the shot comes with the break, not before it.  The catch used
#: to begin at a quarter of the travel and break half way, which felt like a long hard squeeze and then a
#: shot before the wall had been pressed through.
#: How hard it is to press through is what Settings -> Miscellaneous -> Trigger feel sets; the scale was
