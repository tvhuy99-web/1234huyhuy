"""PORT ADDITION (Android build): find a newer app and hand it to Android to install.  On the phone this
module is `platform.updater` (see platform/__init__.py), so ui/updates.py drives it with the same screens
as the desktop's: the quiet check when the main menu opens, Check for updates, Yes, No and Skip this
version, and a download that says how far it has got.

**The check is the desktop's.**  The latest release of the same repository, compared with this app's
`VERSION` by `version.is_newer`.  What the phone takes from the release is the app,
`AudioDefence-Android-<version>.apk`, uploaded beside the Windows and Mac zips; the desktop updater only
looks at zips, so the two never take each other's file.

**The network is Java's.**  `Bridge.fetchText` and `Bridge.download` use HttpURLConnection, which trusts
the phone's own certificates: the Python inside the app may have no certificate store to check GitHub's
against.  A download runs on a thread of its own here while this one reads how far it has got.

**Installing is Android's.**  The whole app comes down each time - an APK cannot be patched in place -
and `Bridge.installApk` hands it to Android's PackageInstaller, which asks the player to confirm on a
screen of its own and replaces the app, closing the game.  Progress cannot be lost by it: the saves are in
the app's files folder (``paths.user_dir``), which Android keeps across an update; only uninstalling
the app removes them.  Android installs nothing from an app until the player has allowed that app, once,
in its settings; ui/updates.py asks for that first (`allowed_to_install`, `open_install_settings`).

**A download waits** in ``updates/<version>`` of the save folder with a marker, as a desktop one does, so
a player who answers Not yet, cancels Android's screen, or whose app Android closes when it is allowed
to install is offered it again at the next start without fetching it again.

Missing files are not looked for: the phone's game data is unpacked from the APK at every install
(MainActivity), so a file gone missing is back by the next update, and a sound cannot be fetched on its
own from a release that has no zip for the phone.
