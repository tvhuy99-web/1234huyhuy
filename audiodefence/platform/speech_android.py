"""PORT ADDITION (Android build): speech on the phone - Android's own text-to-speech, through the Java
Bridge.  On the phone this module is `platform.speech` (see platform/__init__.py); the desktop's is not loaded.

Where the desktop port speaks through NVDA, Prism or SAPI 5, the phone has one voice - the text-to-speech
engine of the device - and it takes the place of SAPI 5 (and of the Mac's system voice): the Speech tab's
rate, pitch and volume rows drive it, in the same units (rate and pitch -10 to 10, volume 0 to 100).
TalkBack is not used: the game speaks for itself, so TalkBack has to be off while it is played.

PORT ADDITION (user request): the engine is the one set in the phone's settings unless the Speech tab's
engine row names another installed one.  Changing it starts the speech again with that engine; an engine
that is gone or will not start gives way to the phone's default.  There is no voice row on the phone (user
request, 2026-10-02): each engine speaks with the voice set in its own settings on the phone, and a voice
saved by an earlier build is cleared (GameParameters.forget_saved_voice).

PORT ADDITION (user request, 2026-10-03): a second speech, a TextToSpeech of its own in the Bridge with its own
engine, rate, pitch and volume, which reads the story, the tutorial and what is said during a game while the
Speech tab's Use second speech is on (`Speech.speak_in_game`; platform/speech.py says what it reads and why).
The Bridge makes it only when it is first asked to speak.
