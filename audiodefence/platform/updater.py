"""PORT ADDITION: find, fetch and install a new build of the port.

The iOS game was updated by the App Store, so there is nothing here to port; this is the Windows answer to
the same problem, and it is written to leave a player's progress alone by construction rather than by care.

**Progress cannot be lost.**  Everything the game keeps - `save.json`, `settings.json`, `keys.json`, the
log - lives in `%APPDATA%\\AudioDefence` (``paths.user_dir``).  The installed folder is
read-only once the game is running, so an update replaces program files and never touches a save.  The
updater refuses to write anything outside the folder the executable is in.

**Only what changed is downloaded.**  The release is one zip of around 155 MB, and nearly all of it is the
game's audio, which is the same in every build.  ``remotezip`` reads the archive's index over HTTP, and
each member's CRC-32 is compared with the file already installed; a build that only changes Python
downloads a few megabytes.  If the server will not serve ranges, or the archive turns out to be zip64,
the whole asset is fetched instead and the update still works.

**Locked files.**  A running program holds its own executable and its DLLs open, so the last step cannot
be done from inside the game.  The changed files are staged in `%APPDATA%\\AudioDefence\\updates`, the
files they will overwrite are backed up beside them, and a small PowerShell script waits for the game to
exit, copies the staged files in, and starts the game again.  If the copy fails it puts the backup back.
The script is PowerShell rather than a .cmd because a player's folder can have non-ASCII characters in it
and batch handles those badly.

**The Mac.**  The same, with the Mac's names: the saves are in ``~/Library/Application Support/AudioDefence``,
the release asset is ``AudioDefenceMac-<VERSION>.zip`` (each build takes the zip made for it, off the same
release), what is replaced is ``AudioDefence.app`` beside readme.html and the rest, and the hand-off is a
shell script, which puts the files in with ``ditto`` and opens the app again.  An app is full of symbolic
links, so the zip keeps them as links (with each file's execute bit), and they are compared, fetched and put
in place as links.  An app macOS is running from a private copy (App Translocation, for an app opened where
it was downloaded) cannot be updated, and the player is told to move it first.
