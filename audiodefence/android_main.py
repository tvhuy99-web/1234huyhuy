"""Audio Defence on Android: the game's main loop and its touch controls.

The Java side (MainActivity, Bridge) owns the screen, the sound output and the text-to-speech.  It calls
``run(home)`` on a thread of its own; this is the desktop port's main loop (audiodefence/__main__.py) with
pygame's events replaced by the touch events Bridge collects.

CONTROLS - the original's own, as it was played with VoiceOver running (the phone is held sideways and the
whole screen is the touch area; TalkBack is off and the game speaks for itself)

  In the menus, VoiceOver's gestures (the port's menus are its VoiceOver stand-in, as on the desktop)
    swipe right / left                          next / previous element
    swipe up / down                             VoiceOver's rotor: a slider up or down, or the next or
                                                previous tab or category where the screen has them
    double tap                                  activate (Enter)
    double tap and hold                         a row's second action (Shift + Enter)
    two-finger scrub, or the phone's Back       accessibilityPerformEscape: back (Escape)
    two-finger tap                              stop speaking
    two-finger swipe up / down                  read everything from the top / from the element on
    four-finger tap, top / bottom half          first / last element
  In a game, ADAccessibleGameView, which with VoiceOver running covers the screen: the touches go to its
  own handlers (touchesBegan / Moved / Ended), and its gesture recognizers are copied here
    touch                                       Gesture: tap = one shot, hold = continuous fire;
                                                Button: the four quarters of the screen (solveButtonPress)
    one-finger swipe up / down                  Gesture: next weapon / reload; Button: nothing
    three-finger tap                            Gesture: melee; Button: nothing
    a finger moved sideways                     turns, when aiming is Swipe (touchesMoved); Gyro and Tilt
                                                read the phone's sensors
    a shake                                     Gesture: melee (motionEnded:withEvent:)
    the Pause button, top middle of the screen  touch it and it is read; a double tap on it pauses
    the phone's Back                            pause (the desktop's Escape)
  In the intro (ADOpenerGameplayViewController, no ADAccessibleGameView)
    one-finger triple tap                       skip it (handleSkipForAccessibleUsers)
    a finger moved sideways                     turns, when aiming is Swipe (the weapon area's pan)
