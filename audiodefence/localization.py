"""PORT ADDITION: an optional localization layer, so a player can read and hear the port's own text in
another language than English.

Where the text comes from.  The port's text is its own - labels, hints, screen titles, the settings rows -
and the original game's, read out of the bundle's plists and `en.lproj`.  Neither is rewritten: everything
the player sees or hears passes through `View.label`, `View.hint`, `View.text`, `MenuItem.label`,
`MenuItem.hint`, `MenuScreen.title`, `AccessibleScreen.page_title`, `data.localized` and, in the end,
`Speech.speak`, so the text is translated on the way out.

How it is stored.  One JSON file per language under `localization/`, a flat map of an English phrase to
the phrase in that language, for example `localization/ru.json`.  Translations are data, so a language is
added by writing a file, not by touching code.  Nothing is translated while the language is English, which
is the default: a player who does not choose one sees exactly what the port always showed.

Whole phrases are the keys rather than single words, so a translation does not depend on how the port
assembled a line.  A phrase with substitutions (`%i` a number, `%s` anything else) becomes a rule, and the
translator writes the sentence their language wants around the same substitutions:

* **Order.**  `%s` and `%i` are filled in the order the English has them.  `%1$s`, `%2$s`... name one by
  its place in the English instead, so a sentence can put the second first: "%s is now %s" can be
  "%2$s ... %1$s".
* **Word forms.**  A word that changes with a number is written with all its forms between braces,
  wherever the language puts it: "I have %i {apple|apples}".  The braces go with the nearest number
  before them (or, if there is none, the first after), and the form is chosen by the language's own rule.
* **The rule** is named once in the file, in the entry "@plural", from `PLURAL_RULES`: how many forms a
  word has and which number takes which.  An entry starting with "@" is about the file, not a phrase.

No language lives in this module (user request, 2026-09-28): whatever is particular to one - its words,
its forms, its sentences - is in its own file, so a translator of any language has what the Russian one
had.
