"""Check that every phrase the game can show or speak is translated in every language file.

The port's text comes from its own code - labels, hints, screen titles, the rows of Settings - and from the
original game's data: the plists and `en.lproj` inside the bundle.  This walks both, puts each phrase
through the localization layer, and fails when one of them stays in English, so a language cannot quietly
become incomplete as the port grows.

Run it with `--language ru` for one language, or with nothing to check every file under `localization/`.
The bundle is looked for where the game looks for it (the `game/` folder, or `--game`/AUDIODEFENCE_GAME),
so data phrases are only checked when the game's own files are there.  Exits non-zero and names what did
not hold; a phrase that is deliberately left in English belongs in LEFT_ALONE, with the reason beside it.
